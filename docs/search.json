      "contents": "\nWe are a group of early career researchers from Canada who created a series of curated datasets with accompanying R-based tutorials. The six tutorials are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code that can be used in undergraduate courses in ecology and evolutionary biology.\nWe designed the tutorials to teach, illustrate, and support exploration of core concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The tutorials span a variety of topics, skill levels, and formats to allow instructors to use as is or modify according to their needs. Please consult our guidelines for instructors for recommendations on how to use our tutorials in the classroom.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Here we provide guidelines to help instructors implement our tutorials in their courses. In addition, we provide a sample lesson plan that can be adapted with any of the tutorials. Our tutorials were designed to be pre-packaged, portable, and ready to use. The easiest way to implement them in the classroom is to share the link to our website with students so that they can dive-in directly in the tutorials section.",

      "contents": "\nGeneral usage\nIntegration into a lesson\nEach tutorial requires between one and three hours to be fully completed depending on the tutorial and student’s skill level. We recommend that instructors plan on choosing one tutorial per lesson as concepts do not overlap across tutorials. This would include a short introduction to the tutorial and dataset so that students are acquainted with the ecological theory, concepts, and ideas behind the data.\nBelow are a series of prompting questions with directions for instructors to embark on. These just scratch the surface on where one can go with these tutorials, the same can be said for the skeleton lesson plan that follows as well. We offer these simply as entry points, but there is no limit for where to take them.\nHow should I use these tutorials?\nAs inspiration for things to teach and how to introduce data and core concepts\nAs a lesson plan for an entire class focused on having different student groups explore all the tutorials and teach concepts back to one another (more student led and student taught teaching methods employed, perhaps 3rd and 4th year undergrads)\nAs an activity as part of a broader lesson plan centered around a specific topic featured in one of the tutorials\nAs a catalyst for discussion on how we can make better use of publicly available data and how we are really drowning in data in the modern age\nHow should I integrate these tutorials into my lesson plan?\nUtilize small groups to explore the tutorials and foster small group discussion\nLink concepts in the tutorial with popular science or recent journal articles that bridge the gap from the data to the scientific community\nAs supplementary review to compliment case studies or topics covered in previous lectures\nHow can I modify these to accommodate other skill levels or topics?\nInclude an introduction to reproducible workflows, open science practices (e.g. OSE)\nInclude an introduction to other well known databases of publicly available data (e.g. GBIF)\nAdapt any of the RMD or tutorials files to include data that is more relevant to a researcher or course, with the option to extend the concepts introduced into larger modelling or research frameworks\n60 minute lesson plan example\nTime\nActivity\n10 min\nOverview of topics covered and/or referenced in the tutorial\nOptional 45 min\nTo make this a longer discussion for a larger course, you could include examples of recent papers (2-3 papers) drawing important conclusions about the topic at hand based on skills taught in the tutorials\n25 min\nGroup exploration of the concepts via tutorials, with the guiding questions:\n\n1. What was the dataset being explored in this tutorial\n\n2. What concepts did this tutorial explore with the data? Are there other concepts you think could have been explored with this dataset?\n\n3. Recreating a given plot or calculation referenced in this tutorial with a new, publicly available dataset. What did you explore and why? Prepare a 2 min presentation with your group to share our how you applied concepts in this tutorial to new data\n25 min\nPresentation of new figures/metrics by student groups, closing remarks.\nReuse\nOur objective was to provide instructors with tutorials spanning a wide-range of skill levels so that they can implement them at different undergraduate levels (1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students).\nInstructors can also reuse our tutorials under our license terms to adapt the content to their specific needs. This requires to download the files of a specific tutorial hosted on GitHub to modify it locally.\nHere are the links to the GitHub repositories:\nDisease Modelling in Mule Deer\nCommunity Ecology: Hemlock Looper Outbreak on Anticosti Island\nTree Diversity & Dendrochronology in Alberta, BC Forests\nR Basics & Data Exploration Using Tree Swallow Life History Data\nSexual Dimorphism & Sexual Selection in Tree Swallows\nUnderstanding Biodiversity with Metrics & Rank Abundance Curves\nIf you have any suggestions on improvements, you can also clone our repositories locally, implement your changes, and create a pull request.\nAdditional topics and concepts to explore\nTo do:\nAugment this section with questions, activities, or learning objectives that explicitly ask students to consider the benefits and challenges of:\nopen datasets\nreproducible workflows\netc\nLink to open science eduction for ideas\n\n\n\n",
