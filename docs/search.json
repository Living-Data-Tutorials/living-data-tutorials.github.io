      "contents": "\nWe are a group of early career researchers from Canada who created a series of curated datasets with accompanying R-based tutorials. The six tutorials are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code that can be used in undergraduate courses in ecology and evolutionary biology.\nWe designed the tutorials to teach, illustrate, and support exploration of core concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The tutorials span a variety of topics, skill levels, and formats to allow instructors to use as is or modify according to their needs. Please consult our guidelines for instructors for recommendations on how to use our tutorials in the classroom.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nGeneral usage\nImplementation in the classroom\nOur tutorials were designed to be pre-packaged, portable, and ready to use. Thus, the easiest way to implement them in the classroom is to share the link to our website with students so that they can dive-in directly in the tutorials section.\nIntegration into a lesson\nEach tutorial requires between one and three hours to be fully completed depending on the tutorial and studentâ€™s skill level. We recommend that instructors plan on choosing one tutorial per lesson as concepts do not overlap across tutorials. This would include a short introduction to the tutorial and dataset so that students are acquainted with the ecological theory, concepts, and ideas behind the data.\n60 minute lesson plan example\nTo do: Build the skeleton\n10 min overview of topics covered and/or referenced in the tutorial\nTo make this a longer discussion for a larger course, you could include examples of recent papers drawing important conclusions about the topic at hand based on skills taught in the tutorials\nReuse\nOur objective was to provide instructors with tutorials spanning a wide-range of skill levels so that they can implement them at different undergraduate levels (1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students).\nInstructors can also reuse our tutorials under our license terms to adapt the content to their specific needs. This requires to download the files of a specific tutorial hosted on GitHub to modify it locally.\nHere are the links to the GitHub repositories:\nDisease Modelling in Mule Deer\nCommunity Ecology: Hemlock Looper Outbreak on Anticosti Island\nTree Diversity & Dendrochronology in Alberta, BC Forests\nR Basics & Data Exploration Using Tree Swallow Life History Data\nSexual Dimorphism & Sexual Selection in Tree Swallows\nUnderstanding Biodiversity with Metrics & Rank Abundance Curves\nIf you have any suggestions on improvements, you can also clone our repositories locally, implement your changes, and create a pull request.\nAdditional topics and concepts to explore\nTo do:\nAugment this section with questions, activities, or learning objectives that explicitly ask students to consider the benefits and challenges of:\nopen datasets\nreproducible workflows\netc\nLink to open science eduction for ideas\n\n\n\n",
