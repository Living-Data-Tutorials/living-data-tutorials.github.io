      "contents": "\nWe are a group of early career researchers from Canada who created a\nseries of curated datasets with accompanying R-based tutorials. The six\ntutorials are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code\nthat can be used in undergraduate courses in ecology and evolutionary\nbiology.\nWe designed the tutorials to teach, illustrate, and support\nexploration of core concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The\ntutorials span a variety of topics, skill levels, and formats to allow\ninstructors to use as is or modify according to their needs. Please\nconsult our guidelines for instructors for recommendations on how to use\nour tutorials in the classroom.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Here, we provide guidelines to help instructors implement these tutorials in their courses. In addition, we provide a sample lesson plan that can be adapted for use with any of the tutorials. These tutorials were designed to be pre-packaged, portable, and ready to use. To implement these tutorials in the classroom, simply share the website link  with students so that they can dive-in directly in these tutorials!",

      "contents": "\nIntegration into a lesson\nEach tutorial requires between one and three hours to be fully completed depending on the tutorial and student’s skill level. We recommend that instructors plan on choosing one tutorial per lesson as concepts do not overlap across tutorials. This would include a short introduction to the tutorial and dataset so that students are acquainted with the ecological theory, concepts, and ideas behind the data.\nBelow are a series of prompting questions with directions for instructors to embark on. These just scratch the surface on where one can go with these tutorials, the same can be said for the skeleton lesson plan that follows as well. We offer these simply as entry points, but there is no limit for where to take them.\nHow should I use these tutorials?\nAs inspiration for things to teach and how to introduce data and core concepts\nAs a lesson plan for an entire class focused on having different student groups explore all the tutorials and teach concepts back to one another (more student led and student taught teaching methods employed, perhaps 3rd and 4th year undergrads)\nAs an activity as part of a broader lesson plan centered around a specific topic featured in one of the tutorials\nAs a catalyst for discussion on how we can make better use of publicly available data and how we are really drowning in data in the modern age\nHow should I integrate these tutorials into my lesson plan?\nUtilize small groups to explore the tutorials and foster small group discussion\nLink concepts in the tutorial with popular science or recent journal articles that bridge the gap from the data to the scientific community\nAs supplementary review to compliment case studies or topics covered in previous lectures\nHow can I modify these to accommodate other skill levels or topics?\nInclude an introduction to reproducible workflows and open science practices (e.g. Open Science Education)\nInclude an introduction to other well known databases of publicly available data (e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility)\nAdapt any of the RMD or tutorials files to include data that is more relevant to a researcher or course, with the option to extend the concepts introduced into larger modelling or research frameworks\n60 minute lesson plan example\nTime\nActivity\n10 min\nOverview of topics covered and/or referenced in the tutorial\nOptional 45 min\nTo make this a longer discussion for a larger course, you could include examples of recent papers (2-3 papers) drawing important conclusions about the topic at hand based on skills taught in the tutorials\n25 min\nGroup exploration of the concepts via tutorials, with the guiding questions:\n\n1. What was the dataset being explored in this tutorial\n\n2. What concepts did this tutorial explore with the data? Are there other concepts you think could have been explored with this dataset?\n\n3. Recreating a given plot or calculation referenced in this tutorial with a new, publicly available dataset. What did you explore and why? Prepare a 2 min presentation with your group to share our how you applied concepts in this tutorial to new data\n25 min\nPresentation of new figures/metrics by student groups, closing remarks.\nReuse\nOur objective was to provide instructors with tutorials spanning a wide-range of skill levels so that they can implement them at different undergraduate levels (1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students).\nInstructors can also reuse our tutorials under our license terms to adapt the content to their specific needs. This requires to download the files of a specific tutorial hosted on GitHub to modify it locally.\nHere are the links to the GitHub repositories:\nDisease Modelling in Mule Deer\nCommunity Ecology: Hemlock Looper Outbreak on Anticosti Island\nTree Diversity & Dendrochronology in Alberta, BC Forests\nTree Swallow Life History: R Basics & Data Exploration\nSexual Dimorphism & Sexual Selection in Tree Swallows\nUnderstanding Biodiversity with Metrics & Rank Abundance Curves\nIf you have any suggestions on improvements, you can also clone our repositories locally, implement your changes, and create a pull request.\nAdditional topics to explore\nAfter students have worked through their tutorial, you may ask them to further explore the importance of open science practices by discussing as a class, discussing in small groups, or completing written reflections around the following questions:\nWhat is the purpose of open science?\nWhat are the benefits and challenges of open science?\nWhat are the benefits and challenges of sharing data?\nHow might a reproducible workflow contribute to practicing open science?\nWhat are some steps you could take to practice open science during your undergraduate degree?\nIdentify one aspect of your tutorial that utilizes open science practices.\n\n\n\n",
