      "contents": "\nWe are a group of early career researchers from Canada who created a\nseries of curated datasets with accompanying R-based tutorials. The six\ntutorials are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code\nthat can be used in undergraduate courses in ecology and evolutionary\nbiology.\nWe designed the tutorials to teach, illustrate, and support\nexploration of core concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The\ntutorials span a variety of topics, skill levels, and formats to allow\ninstructors to use as is or modify according to their needs. Please\nconsult our guidelines for instructors for recommendations on how to use\nour tutorials in the classroom.\n\n\n\n",

      "description": "Here we provide guidelines to help instructors implement our tutorials in their courses. In addition, we provide a sample lesson plan that can be adapted with any of the tutorials. Our tutorials were designed to be pre-packaged, portable, and ready to use. The easiest way to implement them in the classroom is to share the link to our website with students so that they can dive-in directly in the tutorials section.",

      "contents": "\nGeneral usage\nIntegration into a lesson\nEach tutorial requires between one and three hours to be fully\ncompleted depending on the tutorial and student’s skill level. We\nrecommend that instructors plan on choosing one tutorial per lesson as\nconcepts do not overlap across tutorials. This would include a short\nintroduction to the tutorial and dataset so that students are acquainted\nwith the ecological theory, concepts, and ideas behind the data.\nBelow are a series of prompting questions with directions for\ninstructors to embark on. These just scratch the surface on where one\ncan go with these tutorials, the same can be said for the skeleton\nlesson plan that follows as well. We offer these simply as entry points,\nbut there is no limit for where to take them.\nHow should I use these\ntutorials?\nAs inspiration for things to teach and how to introduce data and\ncore concepts\nAs a lesson plan for an entire class focused on having different\nstudent groups explore all the tutorials and teach concepts back to one\nanother (more student led and student taught teaching methods employed,\nperhaps 3rd and 4th year undergrads)\nAs an activity as part of a broader lesson plan centered around a\nspecific topic featured in one of the tutorials\nAs a catalyst for discussion on how we can make better use of\npublicly available data and how we are really drowning in data in the\nmodern age\nHow\nshould I integrate these tutorials into my lesson plan?\nUtilize small groups to explore the tutorials and foster small group\ndiscussion\nLink concepts in the tutorial with popular science or recent journal\narticles that bridge the gap from the data to the scientific\ncommunity\nAs supplementary review to compliment case studies or topics covered\nin previous lectures\nHow\ncan I modify these to accommodate other skill levels or topics?\nInclude an introduction to reproducible workflows, open science\npractices (e.g. OSE)\nInclude an introduction to other well known databases of publicly\navailable data (e.g. GBIF)\nAdapt any of the RMD or tutorials files to include data that is more\nrelevant to a researcher or course, with the option to extend the\nconcepts introduced into larger modelling or research frameworks\n60 minute lesson plan example\nTime\nActivity\n10 min\nOverview of topics covered and/or referenced in the tutorial\nOptional 45 min\nTo make this a longer discussion for a larger course, you could\ninclude examples of recent papers (2-3 papers) drawing important\nconclusions about the topic at hand based on skills taught in the\ntutorials\n25 min\nGroup exploration of the concepts via tutorials, with the guiding\nquestions:\n\n1. What was the dataset being explored in this tutorial\n\n2. What concepts did this tutorial explore with the data? Are there\nother concepts you think could have been explored with this\ndataset?\n\n3. Recreating a given plot or calculation referenced in this\ntutorial with a new, publicly available dataset. What did you explore\nand why? Prepare a 2 min presentation with your group to share our how\nyou applied concepts in this tutorial to new data\n25 min\nPresentation of new figures/metrics by student groups, closing\nremarks.\nReuse\nOur objective was to provide instructors with tutorials spanning a\nwide-range of skill levels so that they can implement them at different\nundergraduate levels (1st, 2nd, and 3rd\nyear students).\nInstructors can also reuse our tutorials under our license terms to\nadapt the content to their specific needs. This requires to download the\nfiles of a specific tutorial hosted on GitHub to modify it locally.\nHere are the links to the GitHub repositories:\nDisease\nModelling in Mule Deer\nCommunity\nEcology: Hemlock Looper Outbreak on Anticosti Island\nTree\nDiversity & Dendrochronology in Alberta, BC Forests\nR\nBasics & Data Exploration Using Tree Swallow Life History\nData\nSexual\nDimorphism & Sexual Selection in Tree Swallows\nUnderstanding\nBiodiversity with Metrics & Rank Abundance Curves\nIf you have any suggestions on improvements, you can also clone our\nrepositories locally, implement your changes, and create a pull\nrequest.\nAdditional topics and\nconcepts to explore\nTo do:\nAugment this section with questions, activities, or learning\nobjectives that explicitly ask students to consider the benefits and\nchallenges of:\nopen datasets\nreproducible workflows\netc\nLink\nto open science eduction for ideas\n\n\n\n",
