      "contents": "\nWe are a group of early career researchers from Canada who created a series of curated datasets with accompanying R-based tutorials. The six tutorials are based on Canadian open datasets with accompanying R code that can be used in undergraduate courses in ecology and evolutionary biology.\nWe designed the tutorials to teach, illustrate, and support exploration of core concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The tutorials span a variety of topics, skill levels, and formats to allow instructors to use as is or modify according to their needs. Please consult our guidelines for instructors for recommendations on how to use our tutorials in the classroom.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIntegration into a lesson\nTime to complete one tutorial : 1 to 3 hours.\nRecommendations : The time to complete a tutorial varies between tutorials and should depend on the student’s skill and experience level. We suggest that instructors plan on choosing one tutorial per lesson as concepts do not overlap across tutorials. This would include a short introduction to the tutorial and dataset so that students are acquainted with the ecological theory, concepts, and ideas behind the data.\nBelow are a series of prompting questions with directions for instructors to embark on. We offer these simply as entry points, but there is no limit for where to take them.\n1. How should I use these tutorials?\nAs inspiration for teaching data science and discipline-specific concepts\nAs a lesson plan for an entire class focused on having different student groups explore all the tutorials and teach concepts back to one another (more student led and student taught teaching methods employed, perhaps 3rd and 4th year undergrads)\nAs an activity part of a broader lesson plan centered around a specific ecological topic featured in one of the tutorials\nAs a catalyst for discussion on how we can make better use of publicly available data in the Age of Data\n2. How should I integrate these tutorials into my lesson plan?\nUtilize small groups to explore the tutorials and foster small group discussions\nLink concepts in the tutorial with popular science or recent journal articles that bridge the gap from the data to the scientific community\nEmploy the content as supplementary teaching materials to complement case studies or topics covered in previous lectures\n3. How can I accommodate the tutorials to other skill levels or topics?\nOur objective was to provide instructors with tutorials spanning a wide-range of skill levels so that they can implement them at different undergraduate levels (1st, 2nd, and 3rd year students).\nOne way in which instructors can easily ensure that their class starts with similar foundations in open science principles is to :\nInclude an introduction to reproducible workflows and open science practices (e.g. Open Science Education) before students dive in the tutorials\nInclude an introduction to well-known databases of publicly available data (e.g. Global Biodiversity Information Facility)\nInstructors can also reuse our tutorials under our license terms to adapt the content to their specific needs. This requires to download the .Rmd file of a specific tutorial hosted on GitHub to modify it locally in Rstudio for example. Please refer to the README on our GitHub repository for instructions. Once the .Rmd files are successfully downloaded, instructors can adapt the content to include data that is more relevant to their course topics. This also provides the option to extend the concepts introduced into larger modelling or research frameworks.\nIf you have any suggestions on improvements, you can clone our website repository locally, implement your changes, and create a pull request.\n60 minute lesson plan example\nTime\nActivity\n10 min\nOverview of topics covered and/or referenced in the tutorial\nOptional 45 min\nTo make this a longer discussion for a larger course, you could include examples of recent papers (2-3 papers) drawing important conclusions about the topic at hand based on skills taught in the tutorials\n25 min\nGroup exploration of the concepts via tutorials, with the guiding questions:\n\n1. What was the dataset being explored in this tutorial\n\n2. What concepts did this tutorial explore with the data? Are there other concepts you think could have been explored with this dataset?\n\n3. Recreating a given plot or calculation referenced in this tutorial with a new, publicly available dataset. What did you explore and why? Prepare a 2 min presentation with your group to share our how you applied concepts in this tutorial to new data\n25 min\nPresentation of new figures/metrics by student groups, closing remarks.\nOpen science topics to explore with students\nAfter students have worked through their tutorial, you may ask them to further explore the importance of open science practices by discussing as a class, discussing in small groups, or completing written reflections around the following questions:\nWhat is the purpose of open science?\nWhat are the benefits and challenges of open science?\nWhat are the benefits and challenges of sharing data?\nHow might a reproducible workflow contribute to practicing open science?\nWhat are some steps you could take to practice open science during your undergraduate degree?\nIdentify one aspect of your tutorial that utilizes open science practices.\nTechnical resources for instructors\nR programming\nR for Data Science: an e-book diving into R topics, language, and additional formats (e.g. R scripts, RMarkdown, etc.)\nRStudio Education: teaching resource with specific learning modules and tutorial for students, instructors, and trainers\nGit and GitHub\nGet started with GitHub: a general resource from GitHub developers on how to use the platform\nGitHub in Ecology and Evolution: a paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution by Pereira Braga et al. (2023)\nGit and GitHub for ecologists tutorial: a tutorial on how to use Git and GitHub for version control which may help instructors on how to navigate our GitHub and reuse our tutorials\nSetting up a GitHub repository tutorial: a tutorial on how to setup one’s own GitHub repository\n\n\n\n",

This is the repo for creating the Living Data Tutorials website.\nFor contributors to the Living Data Project\nStep-by-step contribution\nIf you’re a contributor, refer to the script create_post.R in the scripts folder.\nCreate a branch with a name that follows this format: LESSON/ecological_concept (all branches that host a lesson must have the “LESSON/” key before the name of the ecological concept it refers to).\nOpen the create_post.R script. Edit the title, the author and the date fields and run it. This will create a *.md file you can edit as usual.\nEdit the *.md file and knit it into a html file. Rebuild the website by typing rmarkdown::render_site().\nPush your changes to your branch on GitHub.\nWhen your lesson is done, create a pull request to the main branch and tag @jennsunday and @JoeyBernhardt as reviewers.\nFor instructors wishing to adapt our tutorials in their classroom\nDownload the files in the lessons folder. You can then edit them and knit them in your own computer to adapt the content to your specific needs.\n\n\n",
