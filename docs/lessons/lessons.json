With a publicly available dataset, from the Turkey Lakes Watershed, we demonstrate how to quantify biodiversity quantitatively and visually using R.\r\nLearning objectives\r\nUtilizing historical data from a freshwater lake ecosystem, by the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\r\nIdentify, calculate, and implement commonly used metrics to quantify biodiversity\r\nUnderstand and create figures uses to display biodiversity data\r\nApply this concepts to other aspects of the dataset used in this tutorial\r\nFig. 1: Occurrences of species across the globe from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)Ecologists are often interested in the effects of perturbations (e.g. fires, logging, flooding or pollution) on biodiversity, which can yield information and context for ecosystem health.\r\nHowever, boiling biodiversity down to a single metric can be difficult and incomplete depending on the goal.\r\nWith the help of the Turkey lake dataset of benthic invertebrates, we will present you with a number of common metrics to assess biodiversity, their meaning, and how they can be visualized with the help of Rank-Abundance curves.\r\nYou will then have the option to learn to calculate biodiversity metrics yourself using an R package called codyn.\r\nWhy biodiversity matters\r\nFig. 2: Importance of biodiversity for downstream effects on ecosystem success, structure, and function. Source: Figure 2, Loureau et al 2001, DOI: 10.1126/science.1064088In an ever-changing world, we are often concerned with how organisms will be able to cope with disturbances and increasingly, global climate change.\r\nBiodiversity is the variety of life at all levels, from genes to ecosystems.\r\nNot only is biodiversity important for ecosystems to function properly, it is also an important buffer to withstanding changing environments. When there is high biodiversity, there is a higher chance of some organisms surviving ecosystems that are changing due to disturbance or climate change.\r\nBiodiversity therefore increases the resiliency of these ecosystems and the likelihood that they will be able to persist beyond this change.\r\nTypes of data typically collected\r\nBiodiversity is a broad term, and can be difficult to quantify. Biologists have created several standard measures of biodiversity that convey different information about ecosystems and the species living there.\r\nFig. 3: Schematic of freshwater lake ecosystem demonstrating the different information biologists to collect to understand biodiversityOften times, biologists interested in collecting biodiversity data collect a standard set of responses. These often include:\r\nThe different kinds of species in a given area or environment\r\nThe number of individuals of each species (abundance)\r\nInformation about the area itself (i.e. habitat type, weather conditions, etc.)\r\nIf the work involves an setting up an experiment, collecting the control vs. experimental groups as well as metrics for replication and statistical power\r\nThe time frame over which the data were collected\r\nWays to calculate diversity\r\nOnce we have collected our biodiversity data, there are several different ways to analyse and understand changes in community composition, or the relative abundances of all taxa in a community. Each of these metrics allow us to look at different aspects of the biodiversity data we collect.\r\nSpecies richness quantifies the number of different species in a community.\r\nThe Shannon-Weiner Index estimates species diversity by taking into account the number of species living in a habitat (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness).\r\nSimpson’s Diversity Index also takes into account species richness and evenness, but puts more emphasis on rare species.\r\nThe Evenness Index assesses the evenness of the abundances of each species.\r\n\r\nThe Data\r\nTo explore these different diversity metrics and how they are calculated, we have simulated a biodiversity dataset with 10 unique species and random abundances across 3 years. This will allow us to look at how diversity changes over time.\r\nHere, we generated a simulated dataset of different abundances of species across 3 years. Each number in the species columnn represents a unique species, abundance is the number of individuals counted in a given year. Here is the first 6 rows in our simluated dataset.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, patchwork)\r\nset.seed(222)\r\nsim1 <- data.frame(\r\n  species = sample(1:10, 20, replace=2), \r\n  abundance = sample(0:200, 20, replace=2), \r\n  year= 2001)\r\nset.seed(723)\r\nsim2 <- data.frame(\r\n  species = sample(1:10, 20, replace=2), \r\n  abundance = sample(0:200, 20, replace=2), \r\n  year= 2009)\r\nset.seed(117)\r\nsim3 <- data.frame(\r\n  species = sample(1:7, 20, replace=2), \r\n  abundance = sample(0:200, 20, replace=2), \r\n  year= 2020)\r\nsim <- rbind(sim1, sim2, sim3)\r\nhead(sim)\r\n\r\n  species abundance year\r\n1       2       149 2001\r\n2       7       104 2001\r\n3       8        42 2001\r\n4       6         8 2001\r\n5      10       191 2001\r\n6       4       196 2001\r\n\r\nHere is a look at the simulated data.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nsim %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(species), y=abundance, fill=as.factor(year)))+\r\n  geom_col(position=\"dodge\")+\r\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(name=\"Year\")+\r\n  theme_bw()+\r\n  #coord_flip()+\r\n  xlab(\"Species\")\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\n  #facet_wrap(~year)\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Simulated species abundances for 3 different years and 10 different species. Bar are the abundances of the species, coloured by year.\r\nWe can see that this data is quite messy and hard to find clear patterns in changes across species, abundance, and years. Below are metrics we can use to better define and clarify these patterns.\r\nSpecies richness\r\nPerhaps the simplest measure of biodiversity is species richness (\\(S\\)).\r\nThe equation for species richness is:\r\n\\(S = \\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i^o\\)\r\n(Describe what the variables mean).\r\nStep 1: Count the number of unique species recorded in that year. Then you can look at how the number of different species in a community changes over time.\r\nInterpretation: A higher number means there are more species, and therefore species richness is higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\npacman::p_load(codyn, kableExtra)\r\n#table just showing the number of unique species\r\n#species richness calcs i used to manually enter below\r\nrichness_table <- sim %>%\r\n  group_by(time) %>%\r\n  summarise(richness=length(unique(species)))\r\n\r\nError in `group_by()`:\r\n! Must group by variables found in `.data`.\r\n✖ Column `time` is not found.\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\n#we should probably make this into a nice looking kable?\r\nkable(richness_table, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Richness\"), align=\"c\")%>%\r\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\r\n\r\nError in kable(richness_table, col.names = c(\"Year\", \"Richness\"), align = \"c\"): object 'richness_table' not found\r\n\r\nWe can see in this table that across years, the number of species in the same area fluctuated, some years with more species, other years with less.\r\nShannon-Wiener Index (H)\r\nAnother metric we can use to analyze biodiversity is the Shannon-Wiener Index (\\(H\\)), which indexes across the sum of all relative proportions of species richness’s with an additional logarithmic transformation. This equation uses both the number of species in a specific area (richness) and relative abundance (evenness).\r\nThe equation for the Shannon-Weiner Index is:\r\n\\(H = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_ilnp_i\\)\r\nStep 1: Calculate \\(p_i\\), which is the proportion of \\(i\\)th individuals in the community.\r\n\\(p_i = n_i/N\\)\r\nWhere \\(n_i\\) is the number of individuals in the ith species and and \\(N\\) is the total number of individuals in the community.\r\nStep 2: Multiply the proportion of each species (\\(p_i\\)) by the logarithm of the proportion (\\(lnp_i\\))\r\nStep 3: Sum each of these values for each species.\r\nStep 5: Multiply the sum by -1.\r\nInterpretation: The minimum value of the Shannon’s diversity index is 0, which means that there is no diversity (i.e. only one species is found in that habitat). The values increase as the number of species increase, and is maximized at a given number of species when is an equal abundance of each species.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nshannon <-  sim %>%\r\n    group_by(time, species) %>%\r\n    summarise(n=n()) %>%\r\n    mutate(prop = n/sum(n),\r\n    shannon= sum(prop/log(prop))) %>%\r\n    summarise(shannon = mean(shannon))\r\n\r\nError in `group_by()`:\r\n! Must group by variables found in `.data`.\r\n✖ Column `time` is not found.\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nkable(shannon, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Shannon's Index\"), align=\"c\")%>%\r\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\r\n\r\nError in kable(shannon, col.names = c(\"Year\", \"Shannon's Index\"), align = \"c\"): object 'shannon' not found\r\n\r\nFrom our simulated dataset, we can see that the Shannon diversity increases over time.\r\nSimpson’s Index (D)\r\nAnother metric we can use to analyse biodiversity in the Simpson’s index (\\(D\\)) which indexes across the sum of all relative proportions of species’s richness with an additional square power transformation. Though very similar to the calculation in the Shannon-Wiener Index, the Simpson index is more focused on dominance of species as it highlights the proportion of species in a sample.\r\nThe equation for Simpson’s diversity is:\r\n\\(D = 1-(\\sum n_i(n_i-1))/N(N-1))\\)\r\nWhere \\(n\\) is the number of individuals of the ith species and \\(N\\) is the total number of individuals in the community.\r\nStep 1: Multiply the number of individuals of a given species (\\(n_i\\)) by (\\(n_i-1\\)).\r\nStep 2 Multiply the total number of individuals in the community (\\(N\\)) by (\\(N-1\\)).\r\nStep 3: Divide the number from step 1 by the number from step 2.\r\nStep 4: Once you have a number from step 3 for each species in the community, sum all of these together.\r\nInterpretation: The higher the value of \\(D\\), the greater the diversity in the community. An index close to 1 means that there are several species in the community, and the population proportion of species is even.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nsimpson<-  sim %>%\r\n    group_by(time, species) %>%\r\n    summarise(n=n()) %>%\r\n    mutate(prop = n/sum(n),\r\n    simpson = sum((prop)^2)) %>%\r\n    summarise(simpson = mean(simpson))\r\n\r\nError in `group_by()`:\r\n!

Evenness is a metric for assessing species dominance. If evenness is high, it means most species are of equal dominance. If evenness if low, it means some species are more dominant (i.e. have higher abundance) than others. Evenness is maximized when all species have equal abundances.\r\nThe equation for species evenness is:\r\n\\(E = H / ln(S)\\)\r\nStep 1: Divide the value of the Shannon-Wiener index (\\(H\\)) by the species richness (\\(S\\)).\r\nInterpretation: Values closer to one signify more evenness and values closer to 0 signify lower evenness.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nevenness<-  sim %>%\r\n    group_by(time, species) %>%\r\n    summarise(n=n()) %>%\r\n    mutate(richness= case_when(time %in% c(\"2001\", \"2009\") ~ 9, \r\n                             TRUE~ 7),\r\n           prop = n/sum(n),\r\n    shannon= sum(prop/log(prop)), \r\n    evenness = shannon/log(richness)) %>%\r\n    summarise(evenness = mean(evenness))\r\n\r\nError in `group_by()`:\r\n!

On the y-axis we have the species (numbered), and on the y axis we have the abundance.\r\nThe plots are organized from high to low abundance. Using RACs, we can visualize the change in relative abundance and species dominance over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidyverse, viridis)\r\n# Code or exercise on calculating species richness?\r\n#before \r\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, patchwork)\r\ndata_2007 <- data.frame(\r\n  species = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), \r\n  abundance = c(77, 109, 24, 38, 11, 6),\r\n  time= 2007)\r\n\r\ndata_2018 <- data.frame(\r\n  species = c(1,2,3,4,5,6), \r\n  abundance = c(47, 79, 2, 15, 169, 111),\r\n  time= 2018)\r\n\r\ndata <- rbind(data_2007, data_2018) %>%\r\n  group_by(species, time) %>%\r\n  summarise(abundance= sum(abundance))\r\n\r\n\r\n#2007\r\na<- data %>%\r\n  filter(time==2007) %>%\r\nggplot( aes(x=reorder(species, -abundance), y=abundance, shape=as.factor(species), colour=as.factor(species)))+\r\n  geom_point(size=4)+\r\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"2007\")+\r\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\")+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\", color=\"Species\")\r\n\r\n#2007\r\nb<- data %>%\r\n  filter(time==2018) %>%\r\nggplot(aes(x=reorder(species, -abundance), y=abundance, shape=as.factor(species),  colour=as.factor(species)))+\r\n  geom_point(size=4)+\r\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()+\r\n  ggtitle(\"2018\")+\r\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\")+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")+\r\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\", color=\"Species\")\r\n\r\na / b\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can see here between 2007 and 2018 in our simulated community, there were differences in absolute abundance as well as which species were dominant, which species disappeared, and which species were new.\r\nFor instance, in 2007, species 2 was the most abundant species, but it 2018, it was the 3rd most abundant species.\r\nHowever, species 3 is lost by 2018, while species 6 is gained in 2018.\r\nThis where I couldn’t seem to get the second panel set to show up\r\nRank abundance curves with Turkey lakes invertebrate data\r\nThe Turkey Lakes watershed is located in Ontario, Canada, approximately 50 km North of Sault Ste. Marie.\r\nIt is 10 km2 in area and contains a chain of 4 lakes. The Turkey Lakes Watershed Study (see map) is an initiative by several agencies of the government of Canada, initially designed to study the effects of acid rain on forest ecosystems.\r\nFrom 1995 to 2009, scientists collected, identified and counted benthic invertebrates from various stream beds around the Turkey Lakes catchment.\r\nBenthic invertebrates are small, often microscopic organisms (see Fig. 1), but form an important link between aquatic and terrestrial habitats.\r\nThey can decompose terrestrial matter such as leaves, or consume periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) growing on rocks within their streams.\r\nBenthic invertebrates can be a food source for aquatic animals, like small fish, or terrestrial animals such as birds.\r\nAn experiment was conducted in 1997 where certain sampling sites experienced different levels of logging intensity.\r\nDue to their interaction with the terrestrial realm, we can hypothesize that the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities might be affected by logging.\r\nFig. 1: Various benthic macroinvertebrates under a stereo microscope.

Interactive map of the Turkey Lakes study site\r\n\r\nThe Data\r\nThese data are from the Turkey Lakes watershed experiment. This dataset contains the abundances of benthic invertebrate species measured in the May and June from 1995 to 2001. They recorded the type and number of invertebrates in an area of the stream, with 10 replicates per sampling event. These forests next to these streams were logged in 1997 with varying harvest intensities, with low, medium, and high intensity harvest and a control stream with no forest harvest. First, we will subset the data, clen an process it in order to visualize and compare Rank-Abundance curves (RACs). Later in the tutorial, we will using the subsetted data with the codyn package to analyze the diversity of these benthic invertebrates over time.\r\nThe data “TWL_invertebrateDensity.csv” from the Government of Canada “Open Government” Portal on the “Turkey Lakes Watershed” page (https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/576f1b52-3fce-497e-8e4c-0899acfdca1f).\r\nWe can download and save the data as a data frame object using the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.read = read.csv(file=\"https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub//nrcan_rncan/Forests_Foret/TLW/TLW_invertebrateDensity.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dataset spans multiple years, months, and catchments within the Turkey lakes watershed and includes densities for a wide array of invertebrate species across multiple replicate sites. You can visualize Rank Abundances for any subset of the dataset using the following Shiny App https://ekatko1.shinyapps.io/TurkeyLakesInverts/.\r\nClean and Subset Data\r\nFirst, we will convert the species densities reported in the dataset to the raw counts (i.e. abundances) to obtain whole numbers of individuals.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\ndf.count = \r\n  df.read %>% \r\n  # Convert from wide to long format to simplify the operation\r\n  tidyr::pivot_longer( \r\n    \"Aeshna\":\"Trichoptera\", \r\n    names_to = \"Species\", \r\n    values_to = \"Density\" ) %>%\r\n  mutate(\r\n    # Densities to counts\r\n    Count = Density * 0.33, \r\n    Count = tidyr::replace_na(Count, 0) # Replace NAs with 0.\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, using information obtained from the metadata of this dataset https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub//nrcan_rncan/Forests_Foret/TLW/TLW_invertebrate_metaEN.csv, we can add some interesting details to the data (for at least a few catchments and years). For the purposes of this tutorial, we also select a subset of the data to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\n## Different catchments had different logging intensities\r\ntreatment = tibble(catchment =             c(\"34M\",  \"34U\",    \"34L\"),\r\n                   `Logging Intensity`   = c(\"none\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\r\n\r\n## Logging happened in 1997\r\nyearAnnot = tibble(\r\n  year = 1995:2001,\r\n  trt  = c( rep(\"pre-logging\", 2), \"logging\", rep(\"post-logging\", 4))\r\n)\r\n\r\ndf.subset =  \r\n  df.count %>%\r\n    right_join(treatment) %>%\r\n    right_join(yearAnnot) %>%\r\n  filter(month %in% c(\"june\", \"may\"))\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, we will clean up the data by removing any species whose count is zero across all the different sites and years.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\n## Find species that have 0 abundance across all sites and years.\r\nNA_sp = df.subset %>%\r\n  group_by(Species) %>%\r\n  summarize(Count = sum(Count, na.rm=T)) %>%\r\n  filter(Count==0) %>%\r\n  select(Species)\r\n\r\n## Remove those species from the dataset\r\ndf.clean = df.subset %>% \r\n  anti_join(NA_sp)\r\n\r\n\r\nSummarise Data\r\nLet’s start by looking at catchment “34L”, which saw high levels of deforestation in june of 1998, the year following the logging event.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.subset1 <- df.subset %>% \r\n  filter(catchment == \"34L\", \r\n         year      == 1998,\r\n         month     == \"june\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we can sum the count data over all the replicate sites within the catchment to obtain a total count within the catchment.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.raw.summary1 = \r\n  df.subset1 %>%\r\n  group_by(Species) %>%\r\n  summarise(\r\n    TotalCount = sum(Count))\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, we order the species from most abundant to least abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.ordered.summary1 = \r\n  df.raw.summary1 %>%\r\n  arrange(desc(TotalCount)) \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, we assign a rank to the species (rank 1 = the most abundant species) and filter out any species which are not actually present in this catchment.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.summary1 = \r\n  df.ordered.summary1 %>%            \r\n  mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%  \r\n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\r\n  filter(TotalCount > 0)                   \r\n\r\n\r\nPlot the data\r\nWe make a plot to represent the data. Note that we need to use the stats::reorder() function to get the species on the x-axis in the correct order:\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nplot1 = \r\n  df.summary1 %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Species, -1*TotalCount), \r\n             y=TotalCount)) + \r\n  geom_col() +\r\n  xlab(\"Taxon\") +\r\n  ylab(\"Total count (sum of replicates)\") + \r\n  theme_classic(base_size=16) +  # Aesthetic\r\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face=\"italic\", size=9, angle=90)) # Use italics for species names\r\nplot1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see, Rank-Abundance Curves (RACs) in nature are rarely as evenly distributed as the simulated data.\r\nThere is often few highly abundant species and many very rare species.\r\nAs a result, a log transform is frequently applied to the y-axis.\r\nAdditionally, when analyzing RACs, the focus is on the shape of the curve, not on the species names.\r\nAs a result, we can substitute the species name with it’s rank.\r\nThis is where the term rank-abundance comes from.\r\nThis also has the added benefit of simplifying the code:\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.summary1 %>%\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=TotalCount)) + \r\n  geom_col() +\r\n  xlab(\"Rank\") +\r\n  scale_y_log10() + \r\n  ylab(\"log Total count\") + \r\n  theme_classic(base_size=16) # Aesthetic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing RACs\r\nInstead of using bars to represent abundances, we can simply use lines to trace the distribution.\r\nThis allows us to compare multiple distributions.\r\nFirst, let’s compare the different replicates (i.e., sites) within a single catchment area.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\ndf.subset1 %>%\r\n  group_by(replicate) %>% \r\n  # Order by rank, for each catchment (.by_group=T)\r\n  arrange(desc(Count), .by_group = T) %>%\r\n  mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%  \r\n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\r\n  filter(Count > 0) %>%\r\n  # Line Plot\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=Count, color=as.factor(replicate))) + \r\n    xlab(\"Rank\") + \r\n    ylab(\"log Count\") + \r\n    geom_line(size=2) + \r\n    scale_y_log10() +\r\n    # Some aesthetic choices:\r\n    theme_classic(base_size=16) +\r\n    scale_color_brewer(name = \"Site\", palette = \"Paired\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that there is some variation in the shape and the “eveness” (i.e., slope) of the different RACs.\r\nFurthermore, the highest rank in the summary bar plot was 40, whereas the single site with the highest rank has only 29 species.\r\nThis demonstrates that the more we sample, the more rare species we can find.\r\nAlternatively, we can compare RACs from three different catchments, each of which has a different logging intensity.\r\nNote that all catchments have 10 replicate sites, which allows us to sum across replicates.\r\nAlso note that differences in sampling can affect the shape of the RACs, which means that one has to be careful to account for sampling effort when comparing RACs from differnt studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nplot = \r\n  df.subset %>% \r\n  # Subset\r\n  filter( year      == 1998,\r\n          month     == \"june\") %>%\r\n  # Summarise across replicates\r\n  group_by(`Logging Intensity`, catchment, Species) %>%\r\n  summarise(TotalCount=sum(Count)) %>% \r\n  # Order by rank, for each catchment (.by_group=T)\r\n  group_by(catchment, `Logging Intensity`) %>%\r\n    arrange(desc(TotalCount), .by_group = T) %>%\r\n    mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%\r\n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\r\n  filter(TotalCount > 0) %>%\r\n  # Line Plot\r\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=TotalCount, color=`Logging Intensity`)) + \r\n    xlab(\"Rank\") + \r\n    ylab(\"log Total count\") + \r\n    geom_line(aes(size=`Logging Intensity`)) + \r\n    scale_y_log10() +\r\n    # Some aesthetic choices:\r\n    scale_size_manual(values=c(2.5, 2, 1.5)) +\r\n    theme_classic(base_size=16) +\r\n    scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") + \r\n    theme(legend.position = c(0.87,0.87))\r\nplot\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that we can rapidly see that the catchment with high intensity logging had the highest species richness (highest maximum rank).\r\nThe catchment that we logged with medium intensity also appears to have a less “even” RAC compared to the other two.\r\nIn other words, the slope is slightly steeper for the “medium” intensity site than for the “high” and “none” (no logging) catchments.\r\nOf course, many more sites over several years need to be compared in order to make any generalizable claims about the effects of logging on invertebrate biodiversity in the Turkey Lakes area.\r\nFurthermore, several models have been developed to understand rank-abundance curves (e.g. log-normal, broken stick model).\r\nThe radfit function from the vegan R package allows fitting of these different curve models (see https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/vegan/html/radfit.html)\r\n\r\ncodyn tutorial\r\nLoad Data and Packages\r\nWe will be using the codyn package for this tutorial.

This is particularly interesting when you are looking at how species diversity responds to environmental change. This environmental change can be a single disturbance event such as a forest fire or more long-term change such as temperature increases due to climate change. The Turkey Lakes dataset provides us with an opportunity to look at how the diversity of benthic invertebrates changes over time and in response to logging. We can compare the diversity of different streams with different logging intensities and we can also compare the diversity of streams.\r\nThe codyn package allows us to analyze the change in biodiversity over time using different metrics.\r\nUsing community_structure()\r\ncommunity_structure() is a function in the package codyn that calculates species richness and evenness.\r\nSpecies Richness and Evenness\r\nFor example, we can use community_structure() to look at the change in species richness and evenness over time in one of the Turkey Lake streams. We will choose the stream with high logging intensity as an example. This function can only look at one stream at a time so make sure to subset out the stream that you are interested in.\r\nLet’s take a look at the high intensity logging stream data.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nhead(subset_codyn_high)\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\r\n  catchm…¹  year month repli…² species density abund…³ treat…⁴ date_…⁵\r\n  <chr>    <int> <chr>   <int> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <yearm>\r\n1 34L       2001 may         1 Allope…     0         0 high    May 20…\r\n2 34L       2001 may         1 Amelet…     0         0 high    May 20…\r\n3 34L       2001 may         1 Antocha     0         0 high    May 20…\r\n4 34L       2001 may         1 Baetis    100        33 high    May 20…\r\n5 34L       2001 may         1 Cerato…    45.5      15 high    May 20…\r\n6 34L       2001 may         1 Chelif…    12.1       4 high    May 20…\r\n# … with abbreviated variable names ¹​catchment, ²​replicate,\r\n#   ³​abundance, ⁴​treatment, ⁵​date_yr_m\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is a column for year, species, replicate, and abundance.\r\nThe community structure function has five arguments.\r\n1. df is where you put in the data frame of interest, in our case subset_codyn_high.\r\n2. The time.var argument is where you put in your time variable (year)\r\n3. The abundance.var argument is where you put the column that holds the abundance variable (abundance).\r\n4. The replicate.var argument holds the column with the replicates (replicate)\r\n5. The metric argument allows you to specify the metric of evenness that you want the function to calculate. There are three possible metrics: Evar, SimpsonEvenness, and EQ, which all calculate evenness in different ways. We will use Simpson’s Evenness in this tutorial.\r\nRemember, if you ever need a refresher on the syntax you can type ?community_structure into the R script.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nrichness_high<-community_structure(df=subset_codyn_high, time.var=\"year\", abundance.var=\"abundance\", replicate.var=\"replicate\", metric=\"SimpsonEvenness\")\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can take a look at the output.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nhead(richness_high)\r\n\r\n  year replicate richness SimpsonEvenness\r\n1 1995         1       17       0.2210248\r\n2 1996         1       11       0.5785671\r\n3 1997         1       16       0.3436584\r\n4 1998         1       18       0.2786702\r\n5 1999         1       15       0.3540228\r\n6 2001         1       23       0.2661854\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this returns a data frame with the year, replicate, richness calculation, and evenness measure. It calculates richness and evenness separately for each replicate sample in the stream, so we have a measure of variability within samples as well as variability across years.\r\nPlot species richness\r\nWe can plot this data frame to see the changes over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nggplot()+\r\n  geom_point(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=richness))+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  labs(y=\"Species Richness\", x=\"Year\")+\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure Species richness of aquatic macroinvertebrates over time. Each point is a replicate.\r\nHere is a plot of species richness, with a different value for each replicate. The red line is the year that the streams were logged. Do you see any change? Do you think there are any significant patterns? How does the variability between replicates compare to the variability between years?\r\nPlot species evenness\r\nWe can also plot species evenness over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nggplot()+\r\n  geom_point(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=SimpsonEvenness))+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  labs(y=\"Simpson's Evenness\", x=\"Year\")+\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure Species evenness of aquatic macroinvertebrates over time. Each point is a replicate.\r\nDo you see any patterns in the evenness between years?\r\nUsing community_diversity()\r\nShannon’s diversity\r\nSpecies richness and evenness are very simple ways to look at species diversity. However, as you learned from the rank abundance curves, species have different abundances within the community, with some species having very high abundance and most species having low abundance. Species richness does not take into account the relative abundances of each species, which limits the inferences we can make. The Shannon-Weiner diversity metric does take into account these relative abundances when calculating the diversity of a community and allows us to make more meaningful inferences about how biodiversity is changing over time.\r\nThe codyn package allows you to calculate the Shannon diversity index for a single site over time using the community_diversity() function. We will again use the data from the stream with the high logging intensity. Luckily, this function has the exact same syntax as the community_structure() function! The only difference is that the options for the metric argument are Shannon and InverseSimpson. We will first use Shannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nshannon_div_high<-\r\n  community_diversity(\r\n    df=subset_codyn_high, \r\n    time.var=\"year\", \r\n    abundance.var=\"abundance\", \r\n    replicate.var=\"replicate\", \r\n    metric=\"Shannon\")\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at the output for this function.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nhead(shannon_div_high)\r\n\r\n  year replicate  Shannon\r\n1 1995         1 1.836002\r\n2 1996         1 2.044210\r\n3 1997         1 2.107977\r\n4 1998         1 2.016146\r\n5 1999         1 1.948510\r\n6 2001         1 2.297970\r\n\r\nYou can see it gives us a data frame of year, replicate, and Shannon, which is our measure of Shannon diversity.\r\nPlot Shannon’s diversity\r\nWe can plot these to see change over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nhide\r\n\r\nggplot()+\r\n  geom_point(shannon_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=Shannon))+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  labs(y=\"Shannon Diversity\", x=\"Year\")+\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure Shannon’s diversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates over time.

We\r\nwill also use ggplot2 and dplyr for plotting\r\nand cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(codyn)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLoad Data\r\nThese data are from the Turkey Lakes watershed experiment. This\r\ndataset contains the abundances of benthic invertebrate species measured\r\nin the May and June from 1995 to 2001. They recorded the type and number\r\nof invertebrates in an area of the stream, with 10 replicates per\r\nsampling event. These forests next to these streams were logged in 1997\r\nwith varying harvest intensities, with low, medium, and high intensity\r\nharvest and a control stream with no forest harvest. We will using the\r\ncodyn package to analyze the diversity of these benthic\r\ninvertebrates over time.\r\n\r\n\r\ndata<-read.csv(\"stream_invertebrates.csv\")\r\nhead(data)\r\n\r\n\r\n  year   species treatment replicate abundance\r\n1 1995 Alloperla   control         1         0\r\n2 1995 Alloperla   control         2         0\r\n3 1995 Alloperla   control         3         4\r\n4 1995 Alloperla   control         4         3\r\n5 1995 Alloperla   control         5         3\r\n6 1995 Alloperla   control         6         3\r\n\r\nFor many functions, the codyn package can only look at\r\ndata from one stream at a time. So first we will separate each stream\r\ninto it’s own data frame.\r\n\r\n\r\n# high intensity logging treatment\r\nsubset_codyn_high <- data %>%\r\n  filter(treatment == \"high\")\r\n# medium intensity logging treatment\r\nsubset_codyn_med <- data %>%\r\n  filter(treatment == \"medium\")\r\n# low intensity logging treatment\r\nsubset_codyn_low <- data %>%\r\n  filter(treatment == \"low\") \r\n# control stream (no logging)\r\nsubset_codyn_ctrl <- data %>%\r\n  filter(treatment==\"control\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing\r\nthe codyn package to analyze diversity data over time\r\nEcologists are often interested in how diversity changes over time in\r\none place. This is particularly interesting when you are looking at how\r\nspecies diversity responds to environmental change. This environmental\r\nchange can be a single disturbance event such as a forest fire or more\r\nlong-term change such as temperature increases due to climate change.\r\nThe Turkey Lakes dataset provides us with an opportunity to look at how\r\nthe diversity of benthic invertebrates changes over time and in response\r\nto logging. We can compare the diversity of different streams with\r\ndifferent logging intensities and we can also compare the diversity of\r\nstreams.\r\nThe codyn package allows us to analyze the change in\r\nbiodiversity over time using different metrics.\r\nUsing\r\ncommunity_structure()\r\ncommunity_structure() is a function in the package\r\ncodyn that calculates species richness and evenness.\r\nSpecies Richness and\r\nEvenness\r\nFor example, we can use community_structure() to look at\r\nthe change in species richness and evenness over time in one of the\r\nTurkey Lake streams. We will choose the stream with high logging\r\nintensity as an example. This function can only look at one stream at a\r\ntime so make sure to subset out the stream that you are interested\r\nin.\r\nLet’s take a look at the high intensity logging stream data.\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(subset_codyn_high)\r\n\r\n\r\n  year     species treatment replicate abundance\r\n1 1995 Amphinemura      high         1         9\r\n2 1995 Amphinemura      high         2        24\r\n3 1995 Amphinemura      high         3        53\r\n4 1995 Amphinemura      high         4        15\r\n5 1995 Amphinemura      high         5        59\r\n6 1995 Amphinemura      high         6        37\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is a column for year, species, replicate, and\r\nabundance.\r\nThe community structure function has five arguments. The first is\r\ndf where you put in the data frame of interest, in our case\r\nsubset_codyn_high. The time.var argument is\r\nwhere you put in your time variable (year), the\r\nabundance.var argument is where you put the column that holds the\r\nabundance variable (abundance) and the\r\nreplicate.var argument holds the column with the replicates\r\n(replicate). In the metric argument, you can\r\nspecify the metric of evenness that you want the function to calculate.\r\nThere are three possible metrics: Evar,\r\nSimpsonEvenness, and EQ, which all calculate\r\nevenness in different ways. We will use Simpson’s Evenness in this\r\ntutorial. Remember, if you ever need a refresher on the syntax you can\r\ntype ?community_structure into the R script.\r\n\r\n\r\nrichness_high<-community_structure(df=subset_codyn_high, time.var=\"year\", abundance.var=\"abundance\",\r\n                                   replicate.var=\"replicate\", metric=\"SimpsonEvenness\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can take a look at the output.\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(richness_high)\r\n\r\n\r\n  year replicate richness SimpsonEvenness\r\n1 1995         1       17       0.2210248\r\n2 1996         1       11       0.5785671\r\n3 1997         1       16       0.3436584\r\n4 1998         1       18       0.2786702\r\n5 1999         1       15       0.3540228\r\n6 2001         1       23       0.2661854\r\n\r\nAs you can see, this returns a data frame with the year, replicate,\r\nrichness calculation, and evenness measure. It calculates richness and\r\nevenness separately for each replicate sample in the stream, so we have\r\na measure of variability within samples as well as variability across\r\nyears.\r\nPlot species richness\r\nWe can plot this data frame to see the changes over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a plot of species richness, with a different value for each\r\nreplicate. The red line is the year that the streams were logged. Do you\r\nsee any change? Do you think there are any significant patterns? How\r\ndoes the variability between replicates compare to the variability\r\nbetween years?\r\nPlot species evenness\r\nWe can also plot species evenness over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you see any patterns in the evenness between years?\r\nUsing\r\ncommunity_diversity()\r\nShannon’s diversity\r\nSpecies richness and evenness are very simple ways to look at species\r\ndiversity. However, as you learned from the rank abundance curves,\r\nspecies have different abundances within the community, with some\r\nspecies having very high abundance and most species having low\r\nabundance. Species richness does not take into account the relative\r\nabundances of each species, which limits the inferences we can make. The\r\nShannon-Weiner diversity metric does take into account these relative\r\nabundances when calculating the diversity of a community and allows us\r\nto make more meaningful inferences about how biodiversity is changing\r\nover time.\r\nThe codyn package allows you to calculate the Shannon\r\ndiversity index for a single site over time using the\r\ncommunity_diversity() function. We will again use the data\r\nfrom the stream with the high logging intensity. Luckily, this function\r\nhas the exact same syntax as the community_structure()\r\nfunction! The only difference is that the options for the\r\nmetric argument are Shannon and\r\nInverseSimpson. We will first use Shannon.\r\n\r\n\r\nshannon_div_high<-community_diversity(df=subset_codyn_high, time.var=\"year\", abundance.var=\"abundance\",\r\n                                      replicate.var=\"replicate\", metric=\"Shannon\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at the output for this function.\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(shannon_div_high)\r\n\r\n\r\n  year replicate  Shannon\r\n1 1995         1 1.836002\r\n2 1996         1 2.044210\r\n3 1997         1 2.107977\r\n4 1998         1 2.016146\r\n5 1999         1 1.948510\r\n6 2001         1 2.297970\r\n\r\nYou can see it gives us a data frame of year,\r\nreplicate, and Shannon, which is our measure\r\nof Shannon diversity.\r\nPlot Shannon’s diversity\r\nWe can plot these to see change over time.\r\n\r\n\r\nggplot()+\r\n  geom_point(shannon_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=Shannon))+\r\n  theme_classic()+\r\n  labs(y=\"Shannon Diversity\", x=\"Year\")+\r\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimpson’s diversity\r\nWe can also use the same function to calculate Simpson’s diversity by\r\nsimply changing the metric argument to\r\nInverseSimpson.\r\n\r\n\r\nsimpson_div_high<-community_diversity(df=subset_codyn_high, time.var=\"year\", abundance.var=\"abundance\",\r\n                                      replicate.var=\"replicate\", metric=\"InverseSimpson\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can look at the output.\r\n\r\n\r\nhead(simpson_div_high)\r\n\r\n\r\n  year replicate InverseSimpson\r\n1 1995         1       3.757421\r\n2 1996         1       6.364238\r\n3 1997         1       5.498534\r\n4 1998         1       5.016063\r\n5 1999         1       5.310341\r\n6 2001         1       6.122265\r\n\r\nPlot Simpson’s diversity\r\nAnd then plot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do these patterns compare to the patterns of Shannon’s diversity\r\nover time? How do the values compare?\r\nActivity\r\nCalculate richness, evenness, and diversity using both the Shannon\r\nand Simpson indices for the streams with low intensity logging, high\r\nintensity logging, and no logging. The data for these streams are\r\nsubset_codyn_low, subset_codyn_high, and\r\nsubset_codyn_ctrl. Plot these indices. Do you see any\r\npatterns across years? How do these compare to the patterns in the high\r\nintensity logging stream?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
