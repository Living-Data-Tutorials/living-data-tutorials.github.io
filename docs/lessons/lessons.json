With a publicly available dataset, from the Turkey Lakes Watershed in Ontario, Canada, we demonstrate how to quantify biodiversity quantitatively and visually using R.\nLearning objectives\nUsing historical data from a freshwater lake ecosystem, by the end of this tutorial you will be able to:\nIdentify, calculate, and implement commonly used metrics to quantify biodiversity\nUnderstand and create figures uses to display biodiversity data\nAnalyze biodiversity change in benthic invertebrates over multiple disturbance levels and years\nWhy biodiversity matters\nIn an ever-changing world, we are often concerned with how organisms will be able to cope with disturbances and increasingly, global climate change. Biodiversity is the variety of life at all levels, from genes to ecosystems. Not only is biodiversity important for ecosystems to function properly, it is also an important buffer to withstanding changing environments. When there is high biodiversity, there is a higher chance of some organisms surviving ecosystems that are changing due to disturbance or climate change. Biodiversity therefore increases the resiliency of these ecosystems and the likelihood that they will be able to persist beyond this change.\nWe have hidden the R code that is not part of the learning objectives, but if you want to view or recreate this code, click the “Show Code” button\n\nShow code\nknitr::include_graphics(\"biodiv_scheme.png\") # including an image\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Importance of biodiversity for downstream effects on ecosystem success, structure, and function. Reproduced from (Loreau et al. 2001).\n\n\n\nEcologists are often interested in the effects of perturbations (e.g. disturbances like fires, logging, flooding or pollution) on biodiversity, which can yield information and context for ecosystem health.However, boiling biodiversity down to a single metric can be difficult and incomplete depending on the goal. With the help of the Turkey lake dataset of benthic invertebrates, we will present you with a number of common metrics to assess biodiversity, their meaning, and how they can be visualized with the help of rank-abundance curves.\nFirst, we will teach you how to calculate these metrics using equations and abundance data, and then we will teach you how to use the codyn package to calculate these biodiversity metrics quickly and easily.\nYou will then have the option to learn to calculate biodiversity metrics yourself using an R package called codyn.\n\nShow code\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nprefix = 'https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/occurrence/density/{z}/{x}/{y}@1x.png?' # downloading global species occurrence data\nstyle = 'style=purpleYellow.point'\ntile = paste0(prefix,style)\n\nleaflet() %>% # making an interactive map\nsetView(lng = 20, lat = 20, zoom = 01) %>% # setting the coordinates\naddTiles() %>%  \naddTiles(urlTemplate=tile) # adding our biodiversity layer\n\n\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[20,20],1,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/occurrence/density/{z}/{x}/{y}@1x.png?style=purpleYellow.point\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false}]}]},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nFigure 2: Species biodiversity across the globe, downloaded from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org 2022).\n\n\n\nTypes of data typically collected\nBiodiversity is a broad term, and can be difficult to quantify. Biologists have created several standard measures of biodiversity that convey different information about ecosystems and the species living there.\n\nShow code\nknitr::include_graphics(\"species_scheme.png\") # adding an image\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Schematic of freshwater lake ecosystem demonstrating the different information biologists to collect to understand biodiversity\n\n\n\nOften times, biologists interested in collecting biodiversity data collect a standard set of responses. These often include:\nThe different kinds of species in a given area or environment\nThe number of individuals of each species (abundance)\nInformation about the area itself (i.e. habitat type, weather conditions, etc.)\nIf the work involves an setting up an experiment, collecting the control vs. experimental groups as well as metrics for replication and statistical power\nThe time frame over which the data were collected\nReal-world biodiversity data\nThe Turkey Lakes watershed is located in Ontario, Canada, approximately 50 km north of Sault Ste. Marie. It is 10 km2 in area and contains a chain of 4 lakes. The Turkey Lakes Watershed Study (see map) is an initiative by several agencies of the government of Canada, initially designed to study the effects of acid rain on forest ecosystems.\n\nShow code\nknitr::include_graphics(\"TurkeyMap.jpg\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Turkey Lakes watershed and catchment areas (labelled as cXX). Map reproduced from Webster et al. (2021), which features a summary of the research carried out within this watershed in the past 40 years (circa 2020).\n\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2009, scientists collected, identified and counted benthic invertebrates from various stream beds around the Turkey Lakes catchment. Benthic invertebrates are small, often microscopic organisms (see Fig. 5), but form an important link between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. They can decompose terrestrial matter such as leaves, or consume periphyton (algae and cyanobacteria) growing on rocks within their streams. Benthic invertebrates can be a food source for aquatic animals, like small fish, or terrestrial animals such as birds. An experiment was conducted in 1997 where certain sampling sites experienced different levels of logging intensity. Due to their interaction with the terrestrial realm, we can hypothesize that the biodiversity of benthic invertebrate communities might be affected by logging.\n\nShow code\nknitr::include_graphics(\"benthicmacroinvertebrates_g.carter_noaa600px.jpg\") # include image\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Various benthic macroinvertebrates under a stereo microscope (EPA 2022)\n\n\n\nData collection and structure\nThese data are from the Turkey Lakes watershed experiment. This dataset contains the abundances of benthic invertebrate species measured in the May and June from 1995 to 2001. A surber sampler (see video below) was used to collect invertebrates from stream beds.\n\n\n.vembedr iframe {\n  height:398px;\n}\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(\"vembedr\")\nembed_url(\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNrc9YkPpfA\") %>%\n  use_bs_responsive()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral catchments within the watershed were sampled at ten sites each (for replication). In 1997, some catchments were logged with varying harvest intensities (low, medium, and high).\nFirst, we will subset the data, clean an process it in order to visualize and compare rank-abundance curves. Later in the tutorial, we will using the subsetted data with the codyn package to analyze the diversity of these benthic invertebrates over time.\nDownloading and tidying the data\nThe data “TWL_invertebrateDensity.csv” from the Government of Canada “Open Government” Portal on the “Turkey Lakes Watershed” page can be downloaded and saved as a data.frame object using the read.csv function. We can look at all the columns of the dataset using the colnames() function.\n# load Turkey Lakes invertebrate density data \n# from the Govornament of Canada website\ndf.read <- read.csv(file=\"https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub//nrcan_rncan/Forests_Foret/TLW/TLW_invertebrateDensity.csv\") \n\n# Or, if that doesn't work, from our GitHub:\nif(!exists(\"df.read\")) {\n  df.read <- \n  read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Living-Data-Tutorials/website/main/_lessons/2022-08-26-species-richness-rank-abundance-curves/Data/TLW_invertebrateDensity.csv\")\n} \nNow, take a look at the column names:\n\n\ncolnames(df.read) \n\n\n [1] \"catchment\"         \"year\"              \"month\"            \n [4] \"replicate\"         \"Aeshna\"            \"Alloperla\"        \n [7] \"Ameletus\"          \"Amphinemura\"       \"Antocha\"          \n[10] \"Baetis\"            \"Boyeria\"           \"Centroptilum\"     \n[13] \"Ceratopogonidae\"   \"Chelifera\"         \"Cheumatopsyche\"   \n[16] \"Chironomidae\"      \"Chloroperlidae\"    \"Chloroperlinae\"   \n[19] \"Clinocera\"         \"Clitellata\"        \"Collembola\"       \n[22] \"Culicidae\"         \"Dicranota\"         \"Diptera\"          \n[25] \"Diura\"             \"Dixa\"              \"Dixidae\"          \n[28] \"Dolichopodidae\"    \"Dolophilodes\"      \"Dytiscidae\"       \n[31] \"Elmidae\"           \"Empididae\"         \"Epeorus\"          \n[34] \"Ephemerella\"       \"Ephemerellidae\"    \"Epitheca\"         \n[37] \"Eurylophella\"      \"Glossosoma\"        \"Gomphidae\"        \n[40] \"Habrophlebia\"      \"Haploperla\"        \"Heptagenia\"       \n[43] \"Heptageniidae\"     \"Hesperophylax\"     \"Heterocloeon\"     \n[46] \"Hexatoma\"          \"Holorusia\"         \"Hydatophylax\"     \n[49] \"Hydrophilidae\"     \"Hydropsyche\"       \"Hydropsychidae\"   \n[52] \"Hydroptila\"        \"Isogenoides\"       \"Isoperla\"         \n[55] \"Lepidostoma\"       \"Leptoceridae\"      \"Leptophlebia\"     \n[58] \"Leptophlebiidae\"   \"Leuctra\"           \"Limnephilidae\"    \n[61] \"Limnephilus\"       \"Limnophila\"        \"Lype\"             \n[64] \"Molophilus\"        \"Natarsia\"          \"Nemoura\"          \n[67] \"Neophylax\"         \"Neurocordulia\"     \"Odonata\"          \n[70] \"Onocosmoecus\"      \"Oreogeton\"         \"Ormosia\"          \n[73] \"Oxyethira\"         \"Paracapnia\"        \"Paraleptophlebia\" \n[76] \"Parapsyche\"        \"Pedicia\"           \"Plecoptera\"       \n[79] \"Polycentropus\"     \"Prosimulium\"       \"Pseudolimnophila\" \n[82] \"Pseudostenophylax\" \"Psychoglypha\"      \"Pycnopsyche\"      \n[85] \"Rhithrogena\"       \"Rhyacophila\"       \"Serratella\"       \n[88] \"Simulium\"          \"Stenacron\"         \"Stenonema\"        \n[91] \"Tabanidae\"         \"Taeniopteryx\"      \"Tanypodinae\"      \n[94] \"Tanytarsini\"       \"Tipula\"            \"Tipulidae\"        \n[97] \"Trichoptera\"      \n\nAs you can see, the columns of the dataset are:\nCatchment number. There are 11 catchments (stream study areas), and each has an alphanumeric code.\nYear and month that the data was collected - A number for the replicate (there are 10 replicates for each sampling date, which means they counted the abundances of benthic invertebrates from ten sites within each catchment on each sampling date)\nA column for each of the species with their densities. Densities in units of individuals per m2 were calculated by dividing the counts by the area of the surber sampler (see video above; 0.32 m2 in this case)\nFirst, in order to quantify biodiversity, we will convert the species densities reported in the dataset back to the raw counts (i.e. abundances) to obtain whole numbers of individuals. To do this, it is helpful to transform the “wide” format data.frame (where each species is a column) to “long” format, where species names are all found in a single column using the tidyr::pivot_longer() function.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\ndf.count <- \n  df.read %>% \n  # Convert from wide to long format to simplify the operation\n  tidyr::pivot_longer( \n    # Select the columns we want in long format \n    #  (i.e. the columns with invertebrate species)\n    \"Aeshna\":\"Trichoptera\", \n    # Name the column that we are creating for \n    #  the names of the invertebrate species\n    names_to = \"Species\", \n    # Name the column that we want the density values to do to\n    values_to = \"Density\" ) %>% \n  mutate(\n     # Change densities to counts\n    Count = Density * 0.33,\n    # Replace NAs with 0 because NA \n    #  signifies species absnce\n    Count = tidyr::replace_na(Count, 0) \n    )\n\n\n\nMetrics of Biodiversity\nThere are several different ways to analyse and understand changes in community composition, or the relative abundances of all taxa in a community. Each of these metrics allow us to look at different aspects of the biodiversity data we collect (MacDonald, Nielsen, and Acorn 2016).\nSpecies richness quantifies the number of different species in a community.\nThe Shannon-Weiner Index estimates species diversity by taking into account the number of species living in a habitat (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness).\nSimpson’s Diversity Index also takes into account species richness and evenness, but puts more emphasis on rare species.\nThe Evenness Index assesses the evenness of the abundances of each species.\nEach of these metrics can be calculated by hand using an equation. Click through the tabs to learn how to calculate these different measures of biodiversity!\n::: panelset ::: panel ## Species richness {.panel-name}\nPerhaps the simplest measure of biodiversity is species richness (\\(S\\)).\nThe equation for species richness is:\n\\(S = \\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i^o\\)\n\\(p_i^o\\) represents the proportion of individuals of species \\(i\\), taking the sum across each of these species\nStep 1: Count the number of unique species recorded in that year. Then you can look at how the number of different species in a community changes over time.\nInterpretation: A higher number means there are more species, and therefore species richness is higher.\n\nShow code\n#loading necessary libraries (kableExtra makes tables)\npacman::p_load(kableExtra)\nrichness_table <- df.count %>%\n  # Removing species that had 0 observations\n  filter(Count > 0,\n         year %in% c(1995, 1997, 2001, 2009)) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarise(richness=length(unique(Species)), # counting the number of species that were observed in each year\n            # Check how many catchments were sampled in each year\n            catchments = length(unique(catchment)))\n#Nice looking table using the kable() function\nkable(richness_table, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Richness\", \"Catchments Sampled\"), align=\"c\")%>%\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nRichness\n\n\nCatchments Sampled\n\n\n1995\n\n\n48\n\n\n6\n\n\n1997\n\n\n51\n\n\n9\n\n\n2001\n\n\n65\n\n\n9\n\n\n2009\n\n\n50\n\n\n3\n\n\nWe can see in this table that across years, the number of species in the same area fluctuated. However, this metric is particularly sensitive to changes in sampling efforts because additional sampling is likely to uncover additional, rare species. As a result, the only reliable comparison is between 1997 and 2001, which suggests that species richness increased following the logging operations of 1997. However, this does not tell us anything about how the abundances of different species changed. :::\n::: panel ## Shannon-Wiener Index (H’) {.panel-name}\nAnother metric we can use to analyze biodiversity is the Shannon-Wiener Index (\\(H\\)), which indexes across the sum of all relative proportions of species richness’s with an additional logarithmic transformation. This equation takes into account both the number of species in a specific area (richness) and relative abundances (evenness).\nThe equation for the Shannon-Weiner Index is:\n\\[\nH' = - \\sum_{i=1}^{S}p_i~\\ln(p_i)\n\\]\nStep 1: Calculate \\(p_i\\) for each species, which is the proportion of the \\(i\\)th individual in the\n\\[\np_i = n_i/N\n\\]\nWhere \\(n_i\\) is the number of individuals of species \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of individuals in the community.\nStep 2: Multiply the proportion of each species (\\(p_i\\)) by the natural logarithm of the proportion (\\(\\ln(p_i)\\))\nStep 3: Sum each of these values for each species.\nStep 4: Multiply the sum by -1.\nInterpretation: The minimum value of the Shannon’s diversity index is 0, which means that there is no diversity (i.e. only one species is found in that habitat). The values increase as the number of species increase, and is maximized at a given number of species when is an equal abundance of each species.\n\nShow code\nshannon <- \n  df.count %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(1995, 1997, 2001, 2009)) %>%\n  # Summarise over catchments and replicate sites\n  group_by(year, Species) %>%\n  summarise(TotalCount=sum(Count)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    # Step 1\n    # Note that sum(TotalCounts) calculates the \"N\"\n    # for each year separately because the data.frame \n    # was previously grouped by year using the\n    # function group_by().\n    pi = TotalCount/sum(TotalCount), \n    # Step 2\n    pi_ln_pi = pi*log(pi)) %>%       \n  # Steps 3 & 4. \n  # Note that na.rm = T because for species abundances = 0, \n  # p_i * log(p_i) = 0 * -Inf = NaN\n  summarise(shannon = -1*sum(pi_ln_pi, na.rm=T))\n\nkable(shannon, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Shannon's Index\"), align=\"c\")%>%\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nShannon’s Index\n\n\n1995\n\n\n2.407170\n\n\n1997\n\n\n2.081374\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2.448311\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2.540719\n\n\nWe can see that the Shannon diversity changes over time, with the lowest value being the year of the forest harvesting operations (1997). However, it seems that biodiversity quickly recovers in the years following the harvesting. :::\n::: panel ## Simpson’s Index (D) {.panel-name}\nAnother metric we can use to analyse biodiversity in the Simpson’s index (\\(D\\)) which indexes across the sum of all relative proportions of species’s richness with an additional square power transformation. Though very similar to the calculation in the Shannon-Wiener Index, the Simpson index is more focused on dominance of species as it highlights the proportion of species in a sample.\nThe equation for Simpson’s diversity is:\n\\[D = 1-\\sum_{i=1}^{S} \\frac {n_i(n_i-1)}{N(N-1)}\\]\nWhere \\(n_i\\) is the number of individuals of species \\(i\\) and \\(N\\) is the total number of individuals in the community.\nStep 1: Multiply the number of individuals of a given species (\\(n_i\\)) by (\\(n_i-1\\)).\nStep 2 Multiply the total number of individuals in the community (\\(N\\)) by (\\(N-1\\)).\nStep 3: Divide the number from step 1 by the number from step 2.\nStep 4: Once you have the numbers from step 3 for each species in the community, sum all of these together and substract from 1.\nInterpretation: The higher the value of \\(D\\), the greater the diversity in the community. An index close to 1 means that there are several species in the community, and the population proportion of species is even. On the other hand, \\(D=0\\) indicates a single-species community\n\nShow code\nsimpson <-  df.count %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(1995, 1997, 2001, 2009)) %>%\n  # Summarise over catchments and replicate sites\n  group_by(year, Species) %>%\n  summarise(TotalCount=sum(Count)) %>%\n  mutate(\n    # Step 1\n    num = TotalCount*(TotalCount - 1 ),\n    # Step 2 (Note: data.frame grouped by year)\n    denom = sum(TotalCount)*(sum(TotalCount)-1), \n    # Step 3\n    frac = num/denom) %>% \n  # Step 4\n  summarise(simpson = 1 - sum(frac))\n\nkable(simpson, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Simpson's Index\"), align=\"c\")%>%\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nSimpson’s Index\n\n\n1995\n\n\n0.8372515\n\n\n1997\n\n\n0.7452368\n\n\n2001\n\n\n0.8423991\n\n\n2009\n\n\n0.8757629\n\n\nSimilarly to the Shannon-Weiner index, biodiversity dropped in 1997, but had recovered by 2001. :::\n::: panel ## Evenness Index (E) {.panel-name}\nAdditionally, we can think about the evenness of species across a given area. Evenness is a type of metric for assessing species dominance. If evenness is high, it means most species are of equal dominance. If evenness if low, it means some species are more dominant (i.e. have higher abundance) than others. Evenness is maximized when all species have equal abundances. Multiple metrics can be used to measure evenness, here we show an example of “Shannon-Wiener” evenness, however a similar approach can be used for simpson evenness.\nThe equation for “Shannon-Wiener” evenness is:\n\\(E = H / ln(S)\\)\nStep 1: Divide the value of the Shannon-Wiener index (\\(H\\)) by the species richness (\\(S\\)).\nInterpretation: Values closer to one signify more evenness and values closer to 0 signify lower evenness.\n\nShow code\n# Combine previously calculated species richness \n#  and shannon index tables\nevenness = \n  left_join(richness_table, shannon) %>%\n  # Step 1\n  mutate(evenness = shannon/log(richness)) %>%\n  select(year, evenness)\n\nkable(evenness, col.names=c(\"Year\", \"Evenness\"), align=\"c\")%>%\n  kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = \"Cambria\")\n\n\n\nYear\n\n\nEvenness\n\n\n1995\n\n\n0.6218149\n\n\n1997\n\n\n0.5293657\n\n\n2001\n\n\n0.5865078\n\n\n2009\n\n\n0.6494644\n\n\nAs with previous biodiversity metrics, we find that evenness is lowest in 1997, and recovers in the following years. ::: :::\nVisualizing Biodiversity\nApart from calculating biodiversity using the metrics above, visualizing differences using graphs is another tool we have. One way to visualize biodiversity data is to make a rank-abundance curve. On the y-axis we have the species (numbered), and on the y axis we have the abundance. The plots are organized from high to low abundance. Using rank-abundance curves, we can visualize the change in relative abundance and species dominance over time.\nAs an example, we use a subset of the Turkey Lakes data with six species from the dataset to make a simple rank-abundance curve.\n\nShow code\n#loading necessary libraries\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, patchwork)\n#creating a subset of the full data with just 6 species, across 4 years\nsubset <- df.count %>%\n  filter(Species %in% c(\"Chironomidae\", \"Prosimulium\", \"Baetis\", \"Heterocloeon\", \"Chelifera\", \"Leuctra\")) %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(1995, 1997, 2001, 2009)) %>%\n  group_by(year, Species) %>%\n  summarise(sum=sum(Count))\n\n#2007\na<- subset %>%\n  filter(year==1995) %>%\nggplot(aes(x=reorder(Species, -sum), y=sum, shape=Species, colour=Species))+\n  geom_point(size=4)+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()+\n  ggtitle(\"1995\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\", color=\"Species\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face=\"italic\")) # Use italics for species names\n\n\n#2007\nb<- subset %>%\n  filter(year==2001) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Species, -sum), y=sum, shape=Species, colour=Species))+\n  geom_point(size=4)+\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()+\n  ggtitle(\"2001\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(x=\"Species\", y=\"Abundance\", color=\"Species\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face=\"italic\")) # Use italics for species names\n\n\na / b\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Simple rank-abundance curve with 6 species from the Turkey Lakes dataset, with counts from 1995 and 2001. Colour and shape indicate a unique species, with y axis representing abundance.\n\n\n\nWe can see here between 1995 and 2001 in our benthic community, there were small differences in absolute counts, with the most abundant species (Chrironomidae) decreasing ~5000 in abundance of individuals, but still remaining the most abundance species overall across both years. However, Baetis was the 2nd most abundant species in 1995, but dropped to 5th most abundant by 2001.\n\nShow code\nknitr::include_graphics(\"TopSpecies.png\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: A) Chironomus plumosus, a type of chironomid, also called nonbiting midges, or lake flies (Wikipedia 2022b). B) Baetis intercalaris, a type of mayfly, also known as blue-winged olives (Wikipedia 2022a).\n\n\n\nRank abundance curves with Turkey Lakes invertebrate data\n\n\nAdditional data wrangling\nThe dataset spans multiple years, months, and catchments within the Turkey lakes watershed and includes densities for a wide array of invertebrate species across multiple replicate sites. You can visualize Rank Abundances for any subset of the dataset using the following Shiny App.\nUsing information obtained from the metadata of this dataset, we can add some interesting details to the data (for at least a few catchments and years). For the purposes of this portion of the tutorial, we also select a different subset of the data to work with.\n\n\n## Different catchments had different logging intensities\ntreatment = tibble(catchment =             c(\"34M\",  \"34U\",    \"34L\"),\n                   `Logging Intensity`   = c(\"none\", \"medium\", \"high\"))\n\n## Logging happened in 1997\nyearAnnot = tibble(\n  year = 1995:2001,\n  trt  = c( rep(\"pre-logging\", 2), \"logging\", rep(\"post-logging\", 4))\n)\n\ndf.subset =  \n  df.count %>%\n    right_join(treatment) %>%\n    right_join(yearAnnot) %>%\n  filter(month %in% c(\"june\", \"may\"))\n\n\n\nThen, we will clean up the data by removing any species whose count is zero across all the different sites and years.\n\n\n## Find species that have 0 abundance across all sites and years.\nNA_sp = df.subset %>%\n  group_by(Species) %>%\n  summarize(Count = sum(Count, na.rm=T)) %>%\n  filter(Count==0) %>%\n  select(Species)\n\n## Remove those species from the dataset\ndf.clean = df.subset %>% \n  anti_join(NA_sp)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarise Data\nLet’s start by looking at catchment “34L”, which saw high levels of deforestation in June of 1998, the year following the logging event.\n\n\ndf.subset1 <- df.subset %>% \n  filter(catchment == \"34L\", \n         year      == 1998,\n         month     == \"june\")\n\n\n\nNext, we can sum the count data over all the replicate sites within the catchment to obtain a total count within the catchment.\n\n\ndf.raw.summary1 = \n  df.subset1 %>%\n  group_by(Species) %>%\n  summarise(\n    TotalCount = sum(Count))\n\n\n\nThen, we order the species from most abundant to least abundant.\n\n\ndf.ordered.summary1 = \n  df.raw.summary1 %>%\n  arrange(desc(TotalCount)) \n\n\n\nFinally, we assign a rank to the species (rank 1 = the most abundant species) and filter out any species which are not actually present in this catchment.\n\n\ndf.summary1 = \n  df.ordered.summary1 %>%            \n  mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%  \n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\n  filter(TotalCount > 0)                   \n\n\n\n\n\nPlot the data\nWe make a plot to represent the data. Note that we need to use the stats::reorder() function to get the species on the x-axis in the correct order:\n\nShow code\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nplot1 = \n  df.summary1 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Species, -1*TotalCount), \n             y=TotalCount)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  xlab(\"Taxon\") +\n  ylab(\"Total count (sum of replicates)\") + \n  theme_classic(base_size=16) +  # Aesthetic\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face=\"italic\", size=9, angle=90)) # Use italics for genus names\nplot1\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Abundance of species in catchment 34L of the Turkey Lakes in June 1998\n\n\n\nAs you can see, rank-abundance curves in nature are rarely as evenly distributed as the simulated data. There is often few highly abundant species and many very rare species. As a result, a log transform is frequently applied to the y-axis. Additionally, when analyzing rank-abundance curves, the focus is on the shape of the curve, not on the species names. As a result, we can substitute the species name with it’s rank. This is where the term rank-abundance comes from. This also has the added benefit of simplifying the code:\n\nShow code\ndf.summary1 %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=TotalCount)) + \n  geom_col() +\n  xlab(\"Rank\") +\n  scale_y_log10() + \n  ylab(\"log Total count\") + \n  theme_classic(base_size=16) # Aesthetic\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Abundance of species in catchment 34L of the Turkey Lakes in June 1998\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing rank-abundance curves\nInstead of using bars to represent abundances, we can simply use lines to trace the distribution. This allows us to compare multiple distributions. First, let’s compare the different replicates (i.e., sites) within a single catchment area (34L).\n\nShow code\ndf.subset1 %>%\n  group_by(replicate) %>% \n  # Order by rank, for each catchment (.by_group=T)\n  arrange(desc(Count), .by_group = T) %>%\n  mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%  \n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\n  filter(Count > 0) %>%\n  # Line Plot\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=Count, color=as.factor(replicate))) + \n    xlab(\"Rank\") + \n    ylab(\"log Count\") + \n    geom_line(size=2) + \n    scale_y_log10() +\n    # Some aesthetic choices:\n    theme_classic(base_size=16) +\n    scale_color_brewer(name = \"Site\", palette = \"Paired\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Comparison of rank-abundance curve changes across different sites (replicate)\n\n\n\nNotice that there is some variation in the shape and the “evenness” (i.e., slope) of the different rank-abundance curves. Furthermore, the highest rank in the summary bar plot was 40, whereas the single site with the highest rank has only 29 species. This demonstrates that the more we sample, the more rare species we can find.\nAlternatively, we can compare rank-abundance curves from three different catchments, each of which has a different logging intensity. Note that all catchments have 10 replicate sites, which allows us to sum across replicates. Also note that differences in sampling can affect the shape of the rank-abundance curves, which means that one has to be careful to account for sampling effort when comparing rank-abundance curves from different studies.\n\nShow code\nplot = \n  df.subset %>% \n  # Subset\n  filter( year      == 1998,\n          month     == \"june\") %>%\n  # Summarise across replicates\n  group_by(`Logging Intensity`, catchment, Species) %>%\n  summarise(TotalCount=sum(Count)) %>% \n  # Order by rank, for each catchment (.by_group=T)\n  group_by(catchment, `Logging Intensity`) %>%\n    arrange(desc(TotalCount), .by_group = T) %>%\n    mutate( Rank = seq_along(Species) ) %>%\n  # Keep only species with abundances greater than zero.\n  filter(TotalCount > 0) %>%\n  # Line Plot\n  ggplot(aes(x=Rank, y=TotalCount, color=`Logging Intensity`)) + \n    xlab(\"Rank\") + \n    ylab(\"log Total count\") + \n    geom_line(aes(size=`Logging Intensity`)) + \n    scale_y_log10() +\n    # Some aesthetic choices:\n    scale_size_manual(values=c(2.5, 2, 1.5)) +\n    theme_classic(base_size=16) +\n    scale_color_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\") + \n    theme(legend.position = c(0.87,0.87))\nplot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Comparison of rank-abundance curve changes across sites with different logging intensity\n\n\n\nNotice that we can rapidly see that the catchment with high intensity logging had the highest species richness (highest maximum rank). The catchment that was logged with medium intensity also appears to have a less “even” rank-abundance curve compared to the other two. In other words, the slope is slightly steeper for the “medium” intensity site than for the “high” and “none” (no logging) catchments. Of course, many more sites over several years need to be compared in order to make any generalizable claims about the effects of logging on invertebrate biodiversity in the Turkey Lakes area. For more details about the effects of logging at the Turkey Lakes, see Kreutzweiser, Capell, and Good (2005).\nFurthermore, several models have been developed to understand rank-abundance curves (e.g. log-normal, broken stick model). The radfit function from the vegan R package allows fitting of these different curve models (RDocumentation 2022).\n\n\nMeasure and Visualize Biodiversity with codyn\nNow that we have calculated different biodiversity metrics and rank abundance curves by hand, we can also use existing functions in the R package codyn (Hallett et al. 2016) to quantify and visualizing changes in biodiversity with the Turkey Lakes dataset.\nLoad Data and Packages\nAlong with the codyn package, we will also use ggplot2 and dplyr for plotting and cleaning. First, we need to load these packages.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(codyn)\n\n\nError: package or namespace load failed for 'codyn' in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):\n there is no package called 'vegan'\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nLoad, subset and clean the data (see “Rank abundance curves with Turkey Lakes invertebrate data” above for details) :\n\n\ndata  <- \n  read.csv(file=\"https://ftp.maps.canada.ca/pub//nrcan_rncan/Forests_Foret/TLW/TLW_invertebrateDensity.csv\") %>%\n  pivot_longer( \"Aeshna\":\"Trichoptera\", names_to = \"species\", values_to = \"density\") %>%\n  mutate(abundance = density * 0.33, \n         treatment = case_when(catchment %in% c(\"33\") ~ \"low\", \n                               catchment %in% c(\"34U\") ~ \"medium\", \n                               catchment %in% c(\"34L\") ~ \"high\", \n                               catchment %in% c(\"34M\") ~ \"control\", \n                               TRUE ~ \"natural\"), \n         date_yr_m = zoo::as.yearmon(paste0(year,month), \"%Y %b\")) %>%\n  drop_na(abundance) %>% \n  filter(year >= 1995, \n         year <= 2001, \n         # stringr::str_starts(catchment, stringr::fixed(\"34\")), \n         month %in% c(\"june\", \"may\"))\n\n# summing over treatments sampling events\ndata_sum<- data %>%\n  filter(treatment  %in% c(\"low\", \"medium\", \"high\", \"control\")) %>% \n  group_by(year, species, treatment, replicate) %>%\n  summarise(abundance = sum(abundance))\n\n\n\nFor many functions, the codyn package can only look at data from one stream at a time. So first we will separate each stream into it’s own data frame.\n\n\n# high intensity logging treatment\nsubset_codyn_high <- data %>%\n  filter(treatment == \"high\")\n# medium intensity logging treatment\nsubset_codyn_med <- data %>%\n  filter(treatment == \"medium\")\n# low intensity logging treatment\nsubset_codyn_low <- data %>%\n  filter(treatment == \"low\") \n# control stream (no logging)\nsubset_codyn_ctrl <- data %>%\n  filter(treatment==\"control\")\n\n\n\nUsing the codyn package to analyze diversity data over time\nEcologists are often interested in how diversity changes over time in one place. This is particularly interesting when you are looking at how species diversity responds to environmental change. This environmental change can be a single disturbance event such as a forest fire or more long-term change such as temperature increases due to climate change.\nThe Turkey Lakes dataset provides us with an opportunity to look at how the diversity of benthic invertebrates changes over time and in response to logging, given that areas of the river were subjected to different levels of logging. We can compare the diversity of different streams with different logging intensities and we can also compare the diversity of streams.\nThe codyn package allows us to analyze the change in biodiversity over time using different metrics.\nUsing community_structure()\ncommunity_structure() is a function in the package codyn that calculates species richness and evenness.\n\n\nSubset data\nLet’s take a look at the high intensity logging stream data.\n\n\nhead(subset_codyn_high)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  catchment  year month replicate species  density abundance treatment\n  <chr>     <int> <chr>     <int> <chr>      <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>    \n1 34L        2001 may           1 Alloper…     0           0 high     \n2 34L        2001 may           1 Ameletus     0           0 high     \n3 34L        2001 may           1 Antocha      0           0 high     \n4 34L        2001 may           1 Baetis     100          33 high     \n5 34L        2001 may           1 Ceratop…    45.5        15 high     \n6 34L        2001 may           1 Chelife…    12.1         4 high     \n# … with 1 more variable: date_yr_m <yearmon>\n\nAs you can see, there is a column for year, species, replicate, and abundance.\n\n\nCalculations with community_structure()\nFor example, we can use community_structure() to look at the change in species richness and evenness over time in one of the Turkey Lake streams. We will choose the stream with high logging intensity as an example. This function can only look at one stream at a time so make sure to subset out the stream that you are interested in.\nThe community structure function has five arguments. 1. df is where you put in the data frame of interest, in our case subset_codyn_high. 2. The time.var argument is where you put in your time variable (year) 3. The abundance.var argument is where you put the column that holds the abundance variable (abundance). 4. The replicate.var argument holds the column with the replicates (replicate) 5. The metric argument allows you to specify the metric of evenness that you want the function to calculate. There are three possible metrics: Evar, SimpsonEvenness, and EQ, which all calculate evenness in different ways. We will use Simpson’s Evenness in this tutorial.\nRemember, if you ever need a refresher on the syntax you can type ?community_structure into the R script.\n\n\nrichness_high<-community_structure(df=subset_codyn_high, time.var=\"year\", abundance.var=\"abundance\", replicate.var=\"replicate\", metric=\"SimpsonEvenness\")\n\n\nError in community_structure(df = subset_codyn_high, time.var = \"year\", : could not find function \"community_structure\"\n\nWe can take a look at the output.\n\n\nhead(richness_high)\n\n\nError in head(richness_high): object 'richness_high' not found\n\nAs you can see, this returns a data frame with the year, replicate, richness calculation, and evenness measure. It calculates richness and evenness separately for each replicate sample in the stream, so we have a measure of variability within samples as well as variability across years.\n\n\nPlot species richness\nWe can plot this data frame to see the changes over time.\n\nShow code\npacman::p_load(png, grid, ggplot2)\nimg <- readPNG(\"logging.png\")\ng <- rasterGrob(img, interpolate=TRUE)\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\", size=2)+\n  geom_point(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=richness), alpha=0.5)+\n  geom_pointrange(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=richness), size=2, stat=\"summary\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(y=\"Species Richness\", x=\"Year\")+\n   annotation_custom(g, xmin=1996.5, xmax=1997.5, ymin=20, ymax=30)\n\n\nError in fortify(data): object 'richness_high' not found\n\nHere is a plot of species richness, with a different value for each replicate. The red line is the year that the streams were logged. Do you see any change? Do you think there are any significant patterns? How does the variability between replicates compare to the variability between years?\n\n\nPlot species evenness\nWe can also plot species evenness over time.\n\nShow code\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\", size=2)+\n  geom_point(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=SimpsonEvenness), alpha=0.5)+\n  geom_pointrange(richness_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=SimpsonEvenness), size=2, stat=\"summary\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(y=\"Species Evenness\", x=\"Year\")+\n   annotation_custom(g, xmin=1996.5, xmax=1997.5, ymin=0.57, ymax=0.75)\n\n\nError in fortify(data): object 'richness_high' not found\n\nDo you see any patterns in the evenness between years?\n\n\nUsing community_diversity()\nSpecies richness and evenness are very simple ways to look at species diversity. However, as you learned from the rank abundance curves, species have different abundances within the community, with some species having very high abundance and most species having low abundance. Species richness does not take into account the relative abundances of each species, which limits the inferences we can make. The Shannon-Weiner diversity metric does take into account these relative abundances when calculating the diversity of a community and allows us to make more meaningful inferences about how biodiversity is changing over time.\n\n\nShannon diversity with community_diversity()\nThe codyn package allows you to calculate the Shannon diversity index for a single site over time using the community_diversity() function. We will again use the data from the stream with the high logging intensity. Luckily, this function has the exact same syntax as the community_structure() function! The only difference is that the options for the metric argument are Shannon and InverseSimpson.\nWe will first use Shannon.\n\n\nshannon_div_high<-\n  community_diversity(\n    df=subset_codyn_high, \n    time.var=\"year\", \n    abundance.var=\"abundance\", \n    replicate.var=\"replicate\", \n    metric=\"Shannon\")\n\n\nError in community_diversity(df = subset_codyn_high, time.var = \"year\", : could not find function \"community_diversity\"\n\nLet’s take a look at the output for this function.\n\n\nhead(shannon_div_high)\n\n\nError in head(shannon_div_high): object 'shannon_div_high' not found\n\nYou can see it gives us a data frame of year, replicate, and Shannon, which is our measure of Shannon diversity.\n\n\nPlot Shannon’s diversity\n\nShow code\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\", size=2)+\n  geom_point(shannon_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=Shannon), alpha=0.5)+\n  geom_pointrange(shannon_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=Shannon), size=2, stat=\"summary\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(y=\"Shannon Diversity\", x=\"Year\")+\n   annotation_custom(g, xmin=1996.25, xmax=1997.75, ymin=2.22, ymax=2.5)\n\n\nError in fortify(data): object 'shannon_div_high' not found\n\n\n\nSimpon’s diversity with community_diversity\nWe can also use the same function to calculate Simpson’s diversity by simply changing the metric argument to InverseSimpson.\n\n\nsimpson_div_high <- \n  community_diversity(\n    df=subset_codyn_high, \n    time.var=\"year\", \n    abundance.var=\"abundance\", \n    replicate.var=\"replicate\", \n    metric=\"InverseSimpson\")\n\n\nError in community_diversity(df = subset_codyn_high, time.var = \"year\", : could not find function \"community_diversity\"\n\nWe can look at the output.\n\n\nhead(simpson_div_high)\n\n\nError in head(simpson_div_high): object 'simpson_div_high' not found\n\n\n\nPlot Simpson’s diversity\nAnd then plot.\n\nShow code\nggplot()+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=1997, linetype=2, color=\"red\", size=2)+\n  geom_point(simpson_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=InverseSimpson), alpha=0.5)+\n  geom_pointrange(simpson_div_high, mapping=aes(x=year, y=InverseSimpson), size=2, stat=\"summary\")+\n  theme_classic()+\n  labs(y=\"Simpson Diversity\", x=\"Year\")+\n   annotation_custom(g, xmin=1996.5, xmax=1997.5, ymin=8, ymax=10)\n\n\nError in fortify(data): object 'simpson_div_high' not found\n\nHow do these patterns compare to the patterns of Shannon’s diversity over time? How do the values compare?\n\n\nActivity\nCalculate richness, evenness, and diversity using both the Shannon and Simpson indices for the streams with low intensity logging, high intensity logging, and no logging. The data for these streams are subset_codyn_low, subset_codyn_high, and subset_codyn_ctrl. Plot these indices. Do you see any patterns across years? How do these compare to the patterns in the high intensity logging stream?\n\n\n\nEPA. 2022. “Indicators: Benthic Macroinvertebrates.” October 17, 2022. https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/indicators-benthic-macroinvertebrates.\n\n\nGBIF.org. 2022. “GBIF Home Page.” October 17, 2022. https://www.gbif.org.\n\n\nHallett, Lauren M., Sydney K.

Check out this tutorial where we use the Tree Swallow Dataset to learn about basic R functions and making plots in R.\nThe Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) is one of the most common birds in eastern North America that normally nests in tree cavities excavated by other species like woodpeckers, but also readily accepts human made nest boxes. Based on this quality and their abundance, Birds Canada has monitored nest boxes of tree swallows around the Long Point Biosphere Reserve, Ontario, Canada, from 1974 to 2014. Each summer, volunteer research assistants check nest box contents daily, and band the adults and their young. Nest-box records are available from about 300 boxes from 3-4 sites during this period. Data collected includes nest box observations, clutch initiation dates, clutch size and egg weight, nest success, weather, insect abundance, and banding data. Clutch here refers to the total eggs a bird lays in a nesting attempt. This data set includes all data entry related to eggs, nests, nestlings, nest check observations, and banding data from 1977 to 2014. More information on this dataset can be found here.\nAdditionally, in 2021, this dataset was quality checked and made open access by Jonathan Diamond through a Data Rescue internship with the Living Data Project, an initiative through the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution that rescues legacy datasets.\nThrough Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Bird Observatory monitored three nest box colonies of Tree Swallows.\n\n\n\n\n\nTree Swallows utilising a nest box.

All adult birds are banded, unless previously banded. Plumage color was recorded, age/sex designations were assigned, and a variety of size measurements were taken.\nPlumage Colour\nColour Code\nAge\nDescription\nBLU\nBlue\nMore than 90% of the upper parts iridescent blue-green\nINT\nIntermediate\nMore than 50% up to 90% of upper parts iridescent blue-green (remainder dull brown or brown tinged with green)\nBRN\nBrown\nUp to 50% of upper parts iridescent blue-green (remainder > 50% dull brown or brown tinged with green)\nAge Description\nAge Code\nAge\nDescription\nJUV\nJuvenile\na recently hatched bird, prior to it’s preformative moult\nHY\nHatch Year\na bird hatched earlier the same year\nAHY\nAfter Hatch Year\na bird hatched in a previous year\nSY\nSecond Year\na bird in its second calendar year\nASY\nAfter Second Year\na bird beyond it’s second year\nTY\nThird Year\na bird in it’s thrid year\nATY\nAfter Third Year\na bird beyond it’s third year\nSex Categories\nSex Code\nSex\nM\nMale\nF\nFemale\nMeasurements of Size and Weight\nMeasure\nExplanation\nwing_chord\nwing_chord length measurement in mm\nwing_flat\nwing_flat measurement in mm\ntail\ntail length measurement in mm\np_9\nlength of the 9th primary, or the outer primary feather, measured in mm\n\nAdults are blue-green above with white below with blacking flight feathers (A).

Differences can include size, weight, plumage (in birds). These differences are thought to arise through species that are part of a social mating system, in which there may be varying degrees of parental care ( Darwin 1871; Wallace 1889; Andersson and Iwasa 1998 ). This phenomenon is often seen in birds, where males are the larger sex and have more ornate plummage than females.\n\nImage from ThoughtCo.\nQuestions\nWhy do you think this phenomenon happens?\nWhy are females generally more drab?\nIn which instance to you think females would be more ornate than males? Can you think of some examples?\nTo determine if sexual dimorphism exists in this tree swallow data we will get you to explore the average size measurements taken for each bird. Since birds were tracked using a band number, and birds may have been captured multiple times throughout their life, we will observe the differences in average size measurement taken for each bird.\n\nShow code\n# look at the following variable to see how they differ by gender : wing_chord, tail, and weight\n# will will take the mean of these measurements by band_number and gender\nwing_chord <- aggregate(wing_chord ~ band_number + sex, banding, mean)\n# Boxplot of these trends based on sex\nggplot(wing_chord, aes(factor(sex), wing_chord, fill=sex)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"\", values=c(\"M\"= \"lightskyblue\", \"F\"= \"plum3\")) + \n  xlab('') +\n  ylab('Wing Chord Length (mm)') +\n  ggtitle(\"Wing Chord Length vs. Sex\") + \n  theme_bw() # this changes the background colour of the plot\n\n\n\n\nNice job! It looks like there is a difference between males and females in terms of wing chord measurements. Before moving forward, try measuring tail length and weight on your own. You’ll see we have included what your graphs should look like below for both tail and weight means by sex.\nHint: Look at the example we just ran using the aggregate function first, then plot with ggplot.\n\nShow code\n# Lets go ahead and try calculating the mean tail length and weight by sex and band number and graph boxplots of these values:\n#### these are the answers ###\ntail <- aggregate(tail ~ band_number + sex, banding, mean)\nweight <- aggregate(weight ~ band_number + sex, banding, mean)\nggplot(tail, aes(factor(sex), tail, fill=sex)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"\", values=c(\"M\"= \"lightskyblue\", \"F\"= \"plum3\")) + \n  xlab('') +\n  ylab('Tail Length (mm)') +\n  ggtitle(\"Tail Length vs. Sex\") + \n  theme_bw() # this changes the background colour of the plot\n\n\nShow code\nggplot(weight, aes(factor(sex), weight, fill=sex)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"\", values=c(\"M\"= \"lightskyblue\", \"F\"= \"plum3\")) + \n  xlab('') +\n  ylab('Weight (g)') +\n  ggtitle(\"Bird Weight vs. Sex\") + \n  theme_bw() # this changes the background colour of the plot\n\n\n\n\nNow, to get a sense of how much the wind chord length, tail length, and weight differs between male (M) and female (F) tree swallows lets find the mean value for each.\n\nShow code\n# can calculate the mean female and male wing flat length like this (using aggregate()) or could subset by sex and then calculate\nwing_chord.avg <- aggregate(wing_chord ~ sex, banding, mean)\nwing_chord.avg\n\n\n  sex wing_chord\n1   F   113.5844\n2   M   118.1836\n\nCalculate the tail and weight average on your own. Cross reference your calculations with the ones below.\n\nShow code\ntail.avg <- aggregate(tail ~ sex, banding, mean)\nweight.avg <- aggregate(weight ~ sex, banding, mean)\ntail.avg\n\n\n  sex     tail\n1   F 54.34467\n2   M 55.70160\nShow code\nweight.avg\n\n\n  sex   weight\n1   F 20.41623\n2   M 20.75646\n\nBefore we head to our next section, check out this ornate mating dance between males and female birds of paradise. Note the sexual dimorphism between the males and females!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\nWhat is the average wing chord length, tail length, and weight of the male tree swallows?\nWhat is the average wing chord length, tail length, and weight of the female tree swallows?\nDo these findings suggest that there is some level of sexual dimorphism in tree swallows?\nWhat type of pressures could lead to sexual dimorphism in tree swallows?\n\nShow code\n# Answers\n\n# Male tree swallows:\n# average wing chord length = 118.18 mm\n# average tail length = 55.70 mm\n# average weight = 20.76 g\n\n# Female tree swallows:\n# average wing chord length = 113.58 mm\n# average tail length = 54.34 mm\n# average weight = 20.41 g\n\n\n\nAspects of Tree Swallow Life History\nHow and why do organisms evolve over time? How does natural selection, and other evolutionary forces, shape organisms over time so that they are more likely to survive and reproduce? These are some pretty big questions that Life History Theory tries to answer. Although we won’t dive into all aspects of life history with our Tree Swallow datasets, we will explore some possible connections including: trade-offs between clutch size and clutch number, whether or not bigger birds produce larger clutches, and if clutch sizes have changed over time.\nTrade-offs\nTrade-offs exist when “an increase in one life history trait (improving fitness) is coupled to a decrease in another life history trait (reducing fitness), so that the fitness benefit through increasing trait 1 is balanced against a fitness cost through decreasing trait 2” (Fabian and Flatt, 2012). Traits can either be described as negative phenotypic, or genetic correlations between fitness components of individuals in a given population. Trade-offs are generally caused by limited resources, and competition for these resources, to one life history trait verses the other within an individual. For example, an organism might have a relatively short lifespan–but produce many offspring, or vice versa (think about mayflies vs. elephants for example).\nLife history trade-offs\n\n(Image and descriptions adapted from Fabian and Flatt 2012)\nA negative genetic (or phenotypic) correlation, i.e. a trade-off, between reproduction (e.g., # of eggs produced) and adult survival, one of the most commonly found negative relationships between life history traits.\nThe so-called Y model of resource allocation trade-offs. In this example, a limited resource (e.g., a nutrient) is acquired and deferentially (competitively) allocated (invested) into physiological processes that affect survival at the expense of investment into reproductive functions (e.g., egg production, fecundity).\nA useful way of thinking about resource allocation trade-offs is to imagine the life history as being a pie where each pie slice represents how an organism has to allocate its resources amongst different aspects like growth, maintenance, survival, reproduction, and storage.\nTo visualize whether there may be a trade off between clutch size and the number of clutches in a nest lets visualize these factors in a box plot. The nest dataset contains records of the clutch numbers found in nest boxes across Long Point dating back to 1987! Lets take a quick look at the dataset first to figure out what we need to plot.\n\nShow code\nhead(nest)\n\n\n  year nest_box clutch_number location nest_code clutch_size\n1 1987     MC02             2       MC MC1987M02           3\n2 1987     MC03             1       MC MC1987M03           5\n3 1987     MC04             1       MC MC1987M04           4\n4 1987     MC07             1       MC MC1987M07           5\n5 1987     MC08             1       MC MC1987M08           6\n6 1987     MC10             1       MC MC1987M10           5\n\nNext, we want to look at how clutch size (clutch_size) may vary between the first and second clutch (clutch_number).\n\nShow code\nggplot(nest, aes(factor(clutch_number), clutch_size)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour=\"black\", outlier.size=0.5, position = position_dodge(preserve = \"single\")) +\n  xlab('Clutch Number') +\n  ylab('Clutch Size') +\n  ggtitle(\"Clutch Size vs. Clutch Number\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 13, by = 1)) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) + \n  theme_bw() # this changes the background colour of the plot\n\n\n\n\nLets look at how we would calculate the average clutch size for clutch number 1 and 2.\n\nShow code\naggregate(clutch_size ~ clutch_number, nest, mean)\n\n\n\nQuestion\nWhat is the average clutch size for the first and second clutches?\n\nShow code\n# Answer\n# Average size for the first clutch = 5.61\n# Average size for the second clutch = 4.80\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the second clutches are slightly smaller than the first clutches! However, in order to confirm that there is a statistically significant difference between the two clutch sizes you would need to complete some sort of statistical analysis (e.g a t-test).\nDo larger birds have bigger clutches?\nIs the size and weight of the bird at maturity related to the clutch size? Lets look at wing chord length, tail length, and bird weight to investigate this and lets separate our analysis my male and female birds\nFirst, lets find the mean wing chord length when grouped by year, nest_box, sex, clutch_number, clutch_size and band number.\n\nShow code\n# wing_chord\nbanding_nest.wing_chord <- aggregate(wing_chord ~ year + sex + nest_box + clutch_number + band_number + clutch_size, banding_nest, mean)\nhead(banding_nest.wing_chord)\n\n\n  year sex nest_box clutch_number band_number clutch_size wing_chord\n1 2010   F    PT11K             1    1831.384           2        121\n2 2010   M    PT11K             1    1881.064           2        125\n3 2012   M     MC01             2    2401.772           2        116\n4 2012   F     MC14             1    2401.772           2        118\n5 2012   F     MC59             1    2401.772           2        118\n6 2012   M     MC14             1    2401.779           2        119\nShow code\n# next, you need to double check your data are still in the right class\nstr(banding_nest.wing_chord)\n\n\n'data.frame':   947 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ year         : int  2010 2010 2012 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2012 2011 ...\n $ sex          : chr  \"F\" \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" ...\n $ nest_box     : chr  \"PT11K\" \"PT11K\" \"MC01\" \"MC14\" ...\n $ clutch_number: int  1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ band_number  : num  1831 1881 2402 2402 2402 ...\n $ clutch_size  : int  2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ wing_chord   : num  121 125 116 118 118 119 115 111 117 115 ...\nShow code\nbanding_nest.wing_chord$sex <- as.factor(banding_nest.wing_chord$sex)\nbanding_nest.wing_chord$nest_box <- as.factor(banding_nest.wing_chord$nest_box )\n\n\n\nLets see if we see any patterns between the number of eggs there are per clutch (clutch_size) and the weight or size of the parent tree swallow.\n\nShow code\nplot(clutch_size ~ wing_chord, banding_nest.wing_chord,\n     main=\"Clutch Size vs Parent Wing Chord Length\",\n     pch=20,\n     col=sex,\n     xlab=\"Wing Chord Length (mm)\", \n     ylab=\"Clutch Size\")\nlegend(\"topright\", legend= levels(banding_nest.wing_chord$sex),\n       col= 1:2, pch = 20, cex=0.9)\n\n\n\n\nNow, you look at tail and weight variables.

Lets observe if the average clutch size over time is changing. First we want to take the average clutch size that was sampled from all of the nest boxes each year.\n\nShow code\nnest.average <- aggregate(clutch_size ~ year, nest, mean)\n#Then, we'll run a linear regression to test the relationship between clutch size and year. \nlm_clutch_size <- summary(lm(clutch_size ~ year, data= nest.average))\nr2_0 <- lm_clutch_size$r.squared # for R-squared labels\nrlabel_0 <- bquote(italic(R)^2 == .(format(r2_0, digits = 3)))\nplot(clutch_size ~ year, data=nest.average,\n     main=\"Yearly Average Clutch Size over Time\",\n     pch=16,\n     xlab=\"Year\", \n     ylab=\"Yearly Average Clutch Size\",\n     cex.main=1.25, \n     cex.lab=1)\nabline(lm(clutch_size ~ year, data=nest.average))\ntext(2010, 6.2, rlabel_0)\n\n\n\n\nIt may appear that the average clutch size is declining overtime however when looking at the \\(R^2\\) value of this linear regression we can see that this relationship is not a strong one. \\(R^2\\) is known as the coefficient of determination and it is a goodness of fit measure for linear regression models. Typically, we can conclude that an \\(R^2\\) value above 0.7 indicates a strong effect size.\nTake-homes\nAfter going through these data you have now had the opportunity to learn a bit about tree swallows, and more specifically look at a community of tree swallows found in Long Point, Ontario. This population appeared to show signs of sexual dimorphism, where the male swallows had longer wing chords and tails and were heavier. As well, we noticed that there appeared t be a trade off between clutch size and the number of clutched in a nest. An important thing to not is that these relationships were speculative and statistical analyses will be required to support these findings in this population.\nLastly, these data did not show trends of larger birds having more eggs and we observed no conclusive temporal trends of changes in birth rates over time. It is not uncommon that data is collected with certain hypotheses in mind and trend or relationships are ultimately not found to support these hypotheses!\n\n\n\n",

Based on this quality and their abundance, Birds Canada has monitored nest boxes of tree swallows around the Long Point Biosphere Reserve, Ontario, Canada, from 1974 to 2014. Each summer, volunteer research assistants check nest box contents daily, and band the adults and their young. Nest-box records are available from about 300 boxes from 3-4 sites during this period. Data collected includes nest box observations, clutch initiation dates, clutch size and egg weight, nest success, weather, insect abundance, and banding data. Clutch here refers to the total eggs a bird lays in a nesting attempt. This data set includes all data entry related to eggs, nests, nestlings, nest check observations, and banding data from 1977 to 2014. More information on this dataset can be found here.\nAdditionally, in 2021, this dataset was quality checked and made open access by Jonathan Diamond through a Data Rescue internship with the Living Data Project, an initiative through the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution that rescues legacy datasets.\nThrough Bird Studies Canada, Long Point Bird Observatory monitored three nest box colonies of Tree Swallows.\n\n\n\n\n\nTree Swallows utilising a nest box. Photo by Peter Ward. Image from Nature Vancouver.\nBird Banding\nTree Swallows were banded and banding data was recorded. Each band has a unique number so when the bird is recaptured, it is linked to a database that keeps track of the bird overtime. Once the birds were banded, banders collected multiple measurements including species, age, sex, body condition, bird colour, wing length, cord length and mass. For more information on banding, check out this Government of Canada resource that includes descriptions of banding data codes used by the Bird Banding Laboratory.\nCheck out this video below to see how birds are banded, courtesy of the Monomoy Bird Observatory in Cape Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTree Swallow Age\nYou might be asking, how can you tell how old a bird is? For the most part, banders rely on the bird’s wing feathers to determine their age. However, after the bird is 2 years old, it’s very difficult to reliably age the birds. Only recapture data can help determine the age of the banded bird after it’s older than 2 years.\nBelow are age codes used to age birds:\nAge Code\nAge\nDescription\nJUV\nJuvenile\na recently hatched bird, prior to it’s preformative moult\nHY\nHatch Year\na bird hatched earlier the same year\nAHY\nAfter Hatch Year\na bird hatched in a previous year\nSY\nSecond Year\na bird in its second calendar year\nASY\nAfter Second Year\na bird beyond it’s second year\nTY\nThird Year\na bird in it’s thrid year\nATY\nAfter Third Year\na bird beyond it’s third year\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling R\nTo navigate and complete the following tutorials you will be required to install R and we encourage you to install R Studio.\nR is a freely available software and the most recent version of R can be downloaded from: https://cran.r-project.org. After you have installed R, we encourage you to download R Studio as it provides a more user friendly interface to interact with R. R Studio Desktop is freely available from https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.\nThe final piece of software that is required for completing the practicals is rmarkdown. Rmarkdown documents weave together narrative text and code to produce formatted, reproducible outputs. If you are unfamiliar with rmarkdown, a short tutorial is available from https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html.\nOverview of R concepts\nIn this next section we are going to walk you through a few of the concepts you need to understand in order to work with data in R.\nImporting data and packages\nIn order to work with certain set of data in R, you must first pull them into the program. Before we can pull packages into R, you will first have to install them onto your computer. Run the following code below to download the required packages (without the #s). You only need to install the packages once.\n\nShow code\n# install.packages(\"dplyr\")\n# install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n# install.packages(\"tidyr\")\n# install.packages(\"lubridate\")\n# install.packages(\"reshape\")\n# install.packages(\"readr\")\n\n\n\nNow we can start running those packages by calling on them using the following code:\n\nShow code\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(reshape)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, we need to pull the actual datasets into R using the read.csv() function, where banding is the name of the object (or in this case datraframe) and the path to the file is within the ().\n\nShow code\nbanding <- read.csv(\"TRES/banding_final.csv\") #this dataset set contains banding information\nnest <- read.csv(\"TRES/nest_final.csv\") #this dataset contains nest information\nnestling <- read.csv(\"TRES/nestling_final.csv\") #this dataset contains nestling information\n\n\n\nData Exploration\nLet’s do some data exploring! First, let’s see what is in the banding dataset. This will help give us a better idea of what we can look at. Look into the first few rows of the banding dataset. You can do this using the head() function.\n\nShow code\nhead(banding) # where head() is the function and banding is the dataset\n\n\n  band_or_recapture band_number sex colour wing_chord wing_flat tail\n1                 R    1831.386   F    BLU        116       119   58\n2                 R    1881.065   F    BLU        115       119   54\n3                 R    2171.200   F    BLU        112       114   55\n4                 R    1881.064   M    BLU        123       124   60\n5                 B    2351.397   M    BLU        118       119   58\n6                 R    1881.042   M    BLU        123       125   56\n  p_9 weight       date nest_box age_code year\n1  89   22.0 2010-06-01     PT4G      ASY 2010\n2  90   19.6 2010-06-01     PT2F      ASY 2010\n3  88   21.5 2010-06-01    PT15G      ASY 2010\n4  96   21.1 2010-06-01     PT4G      AHY 2010\n5  92   22.1 2010-06-01    PT15G      AHY 2010\n6  97   20.5 2010-06-01     PT2F      AHY 2010\n\nThere are 13 columns in the dataset, each representing a measurement taken when the bird was banded where:\nColumn Name\nExplanation\nband_or_recapture\nwhether the bird has been banded at the time of data entry or previously banded (i.e., has a band already) by B = band and R = recapture\nband_number\nband number, either from the recaptured birds that already have a band or a new band number\nsex\nsex of the bird by F = female and M = male\ncolour\ncolour of the bird where BLU = blue, BRN = brown, and INT = intermediate\nwing_chord\nwing_chord measurement in mm\nwing_flat\nwing_flat measurement in mm\ntail\ntail measurement in mm\np_9\nlength of the 9th primary, or the outer primary feather, measured in mm\nweight\nweight of the bird in grams\ndate\ndate the bird was captured recorded as yyyy-mm-dd\nnest_box\nlabeled by site and box number with no spaces\nage_code\nage of the bird when captured (see previous section for descriptions)\nyear\nyear the bird was captured and all above data was collected\nYou can dig in deeper by using the summary() and str() functions. This is important, because the variables need to match what they are being used for (i.e., to calculate mean, the variable must be numeric (num), not a character (chr), integer (int), or factor (Factor) type).\n\nShow code\n# summarise the banding dataset\nsummary(banding) \n\n\n band_or_recapture   band_number       sex           \n Length:1602        Min.   :1381   Length:1602       \n Class :character   1st Qu.:2312   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Median :2351   Mode  :character  \n                    Mean   :2310                     \n                    3rd Qu.:2402                     \n                    Max.   :5212                     \n    colour            wing_chord      wing_flat          tail      \n Length:1602        Min.   :100.0   Min.   :102.0   Min.   :44.00  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:113.0   1st Qu.:115.0   1st Qu.:53.00  \n Mode  :character   Median :116.0   Median :118.0   Median :55.00  \n                    Mean   :115.7   Mean   :117.9   Mean   :54.98  \n                    3rd Qu.:118.0   3rd Qu.:121.0   3rd Qu.:57.00  \n                    Max.   :129.0   Max.   :130.0   Max.   :69.00  \n      p_9             weight          date          \n Min.   : 78.00   Min.   :16.50   Length:1602       \n 1st Qu.: 90.00   1st Qu.:19.80   Class :character  \n Median : 92.00   Median :20.50   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 92.39   Mean   :20.58                     \n 3rd Qu.: 95.00   3rd Qu.:21.40                     \n Max.   :109.00   Max.   :25.90                     \n   nest_box           age_code              year     \n Length:1602        Length:1602        Min.   :2010  \n Class :character   Class :character   1st Qu.:2011  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Median :2012  \n                                       Mean   :2012  \n                                       3rd Qu.:2013  \n                                       Max.   :2014  \nShow code\n# check the structure of the banding dataset\nstr(banding) #This is important, because the variables need to match what they are being used for (i.e., to calculate mean, the variable must be numeric, not a character type)\n\n\n'data.frame':   1602 obs. of  13 variables:\n $ band_or_recapture: chr  \"R\" \"R\" \"R\" \"R\" ...\n $ band_number      : num  1831 1881 2171 1881 2351 ...\n $ sex              : chr  \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"M\" ...\n $ colour           : chr  \"BLU\" \"BLU\" \"BLU\" \"BLU\" ...\n $ wing_chord       : num  116 115 112 123 118 123 110 111 112 117 ...\n $ wing_flat        : num  119 119 114 124 119 125 112 113 114 118 ...\n $ tail             : num  58 54 55 60 58 56 55 52 55 54 ...\n $ p_9              : int  89 90 88 96 92 97 89 87 90 92 ...\n $ weight           : num  22 19.6 21.5 21.1 22.1 20.5 20 21.6 19.8 20.5 ...\n $ date             : chr  \"2010-06-01\" \"2010-06-01\" \"2010-06-01\" \"2010-06-01\" ...\n $ nest_box         : chr  \"PT4G\" \"PT2F\" \"PT15G\" \"PT4G\" ...\n $ age_code         : chr  \"ASY\" \"ASY\" \"ASY\" \"AHY\" ...\n $ year             : int  2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 ...\n\nSubsetting and conditional subsetting elements\nThe [ operator can be used to select multiple elements of an object: The [ operator can be used to extract specific rows or columns from a data set where DATA[row, column]\nThe $ operator can be used to extract elements by the element’s name\nLet’s try pulling the first row from the banding dataset\n\nShow code\nbanding[c(1),] #notice how there is a comma after c(1)?

You can wrap these in different functions to calculate various things. For example, let’s try calculating the mean weight from our banding2 dataset and assign it to a new variable called mean_weight. The following line of code creates a column in banding2 called mean_weight and assigns the mean of the column weight from banding2 to it. Then use the head() function to take a quick look.\n\nShow code\nbanding2$mean_weight <- mean(banding2$weight)\n\nhead(banding2)\n\n\n  band_number wing_chord wing_flat tail p_9 weight       date\n1    1831.386        116       119   58  89   22.0 2010-06-01\n2    1881.065        115       119   54  90   19.6 2010-06-01\n3    2171.200        112       114   55  88   21.5 2010-06-01\n4    1881.064        123       124   60  96   21.1 2010-06-01\n5    2351.397        118       119   58  92   22.1 2010-06-01\n6    1881.042        123       125   56  97   20.5 2010-06-01\n  nest_box age_code year mean_weight\n1     PT4G      ASY 2010      20.815\n2     PT2F      ASY 2010      20.815\n3    PT15G      ASY 2010      20.815\n4     PT4G      AHY 2010      20.815\n5    PT15G      AHY 2010      20.815\n6     PT2F      AHY 2010      20.815\n\nWhat if we wanted to calculate the mean weight of the Tree Swallows as recorded in the banding dataset based on their sex? We could do that by grouping how we calculate the mean by using the aggregate() function. The aggregate function can work to group data as follows:\naggregate(y ~ a + b + c + …, df, mean)\nWhere y is the variable you want to take the mean of, a, b, c… are variables that you are interested in grouping these means by, df is the dataframe that you are pulling these data from, and mean is instructing the command that the summary statistic you want to complete is the mean. Lets try it out!\n\nShow code\n# If we wanted to look at the average weight of female and male birds in the banding dataset we would use aggregate() like this\nbanding3 <- aggregate(weight ~ sex, banding, mean) # banding3 is where these values will be stored\nbanding3\n\n\n  sex   weight\n1   F 20.41623\n2   M 20.75646\n\nTry coding\n\n\n# Try looking at the mean weight of Tree Swallows grouped by sex and year, call this new data frame 'banding4'\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Answer\n# banding3 <- aggregate(weight ~ sex, year, mean)\n\n\n\nLogical operators\nNow that you have a good handle on basic subsetting, let’s dig a little deeper and use logical operators to further subset your data.\nWhat if you want to focus in on looking at just one sex? How would you extract only data related to female birds from these data? One way to do this would be to use the subset() function and logical operators to separate out the data of interests from your data set.\n< (less than)\n<= (less than or equal to)\n> (greater than)\n>= (greater than or equal to)\n== (exactly equal to)\n!= (not equal to)\nx | y (x OR y)\nx & y (x AND y)\nIt is important to note that certain logical operators only work on certain classes of data. For example, if we looked at sex (class of factor) we can’t subset values that are less than or equal to Female (this would make no sense since Female is not a number or integer!).\n\nShow code\n# pull out female birds from your banding dataset \nhead(subset(banding, sex == \"F\")) #the head function limits the amount of rows displayed\n\n\n  band_or_recapture band_number sex colour wing_chord wing_flat tail\n1                 R    1831.386   F    BLU        116       119   58\n2                 R    1881.065   F    BLU        115       119   54\n3                 R    2171.200   F    BLU        112       114   55\n7                 B    2351.397   F    BLU        110       112   55\n8                 R    2321.083   F    BLU        111       113   52\n9                 B    2351.397   F    INT        112       114   55\n  p_9 weight       date nest_box age_code year\n1  89   22.0 2010-06-01     PT4G      ASY 2010\n2  90   19.6 2010-06-01     PT2F      ASY 2010\n3  88   21.5 2010-06-01    PT15G      ASY 2010\n7  89   20.0 2012-06-01     PT1J      ASY 2010\n8  87   21.6 2012-06-01     PT4J      ASY 2010\n9  90   19.8 2012-06-01     PT8K      AHY 2010\n\nRemember, if you want to store this in a df to look at later I would have to assign it to a vector called “female_birds”.\n\n\nfemale_birds <- subset(banding, sex == \"F\")\nhead(female_birds)\n\n# what if you wanted to look at female birds that weighed over 20g?\nfemale_birds <- subset(banding, sex == \"F\" & weight > 20)\nhead(female_birds)\n\n\n\nNotice how the vector female_birds changed from 853 observations to 495 observations?\nTry coding\n\n\n# Try to subset a dataframe called 'male_birds' that consists of male birds with the chord_length less than or equal to 150\n\n\n\n\nShow code\n# Answer\n# male_birds <- subset(banding, sex == \"M\" & chord_length <= 150)\n\n\n\nQuestion\nHow many male birds have a chord_length less than or equal to 150?\n\nShow code\n# Answer = 749\n\n\n\nGraphing basics\nHaving fun yet? I know I am! Let’s look at the basics of a plot.\n\nNow that we are refreshed in the elements of a graph, let’s graph a relatively simple bar plot with our banding data frame.\nLet’s look at the number of banded and recaptured birds there were each year. We will use ggplot to visualize the data.\n\nShow code\n# First, we will create a table base on the band_or_recapture column and the year column\ntbl1 <- with(banding, table(band_or_recapture, year))  \ntbl1\n\n\n                 year\nband_or_recapture 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\n                B   62  125  118   68  101\n                R  179  264  292  139  254\nShow code\n# Next, we can plot our table \nggplot(as.data.frame(tbl1), aes(x =factor(year), y = Freq, fill = band_or_recapture))+ #we've changed the format of our table to a dataframe so we can plot it. \n  geom_col(position = 'dodge') #geom_column is the type of graph, and position='dodge' allows us to visualize the barplots side by side.\n\n\n\n\nCongrats! You’ve made your first graph. We can change elements of the graph by adding labels and titles, changing the theme and colours of our bars.\n\nShow code\n# Add labels and change colours\nggplot(as.data.frame(tbl1), aes(x =factor(year), y = Freq, fill = band_or_recapture))+ \n  geom_col(position = 'dodge') +\n  xlab('Year') +\n  ylab('Number of birds') +\n  scale_fill_manual(name= \"Banded or Recaptured\", values=c(\"B\" = 'lightskyblue', \"R\" = 'plum3'))+\n  ggtitle(\"Birds banded or recaptured from 2010-2014\") +\n  theme_classic() #gets rid of grey background\n\n\n\n\n(If you’d like to learn more about ggplot, this tutorial is great!)\nQuestion\nWhat trends do you see?\nWhy do you think there are more recaptured birds compared to banded birds every year?\nMore data exploration\nNext, let’s change gears and take a quick look at the egg nestling dataset.\n\n\n# Lets get a sense of what columns are present in our dataset\nhead(nestling)\n\n\n  nest_box band_number year clutch_number day_1_weight day_12_weight\n1     PT7F  2351.39972 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n2     PT7F  2351.39973 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n3     PT7F  2351.39974 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n4    PT14G  2351.39975 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n5    PT14G  2351.39976 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n6    PT14G  2351.39977 2014            NA         <NA>          <NA>\n  site nest_code\n1 <NA>      <NA>\n2 <NA>      <NA>\n3 <NA>      <NA>\n4 <NA>      <NA>\n5 <NA>      <NA>\n6 <NA>      <NA>\n\n# Lets look at the structure of our new dataframe, nestling:\n\nstr(nestling)\n\n\n'data.frame':   32536 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ nest_box     : chr  \"PT7F\" \"PT7F\" \"PT7F\" \"PT14G\" ...\n $ band_number  : chr  \"2351.39972\" \"2351.39973\" \"2351.39974\" \"2351.39975\" ...\n $ year         : int  2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 2014 ...\n $ clutch_number: int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ day_1_weight : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ day_12_weight: chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ site         : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ nest_code    : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n\n\nShow code\n#We don't have entries for all rows of our dataframe.

There seems to be an outlier within the data. If we assume this is a data entry error, we can get rid of it. Since it looks like an earlier date, let’s just look at the first few rows (n = 10) and see if we can find the outlier.\n\nShow code\nhead(nestling_weight2, n = 10)\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n    year weight     total\n   <int> <chr>      <dbl>\n 1  1977 mean_day_1 21.8 \n 2  1978 mean_day_1  1.76\n 3  1979 mean_day_1  1.69\n 4  1980 mean_day_1  2.18\n 5  1981 mean_day_1  2.03\n 6  1982 mean_day_1  2.54\n 7  1983 mean_day_1  1.90\n 8  1984 mean_day_1  1.57\n 9  1985 mean_day_1  1.68\n10  1986 mean_day_1  1.59\n\nAh ha! The first row contains a mean_day_1 weight of 21.8. This is likely an error. Let’s get rid of it and then re-plot it.\n\nShow code\nnestling_weight2 <- nestling_weight2[-1,]\nggplot(data = nestling_weight2,\n       aes(x = year, y = total, group = weight)) + #Year goes on the x axis, weight(totals) on the y axis, and we group by each the means of each day\n  geom_line(aes(linetype = weight, color = weight)) + #aes changes the aesthetics of the lines so that linetype and colors are different from each other\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\nMuch better!\nQuestions\nDo you see any trends within this datasets over time?\nWhat other variables could you look at within the nestling dataset?\nNext Steps\nYou have completed the “Getting familiar with R and the Tree Swallow Dataset” tutorial!\nLooking for more of a challenge?
