This tutorial uses a tree damage dataset from Anticosti Island during a hemlock looper outbreak in 1973. The dataset can be found on the government of Canada's official [data portal](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/9dda09b0-649f-4002-b207-7b204eb81cbb). We would like to thank Anne Cotton-Gagnon, MSc, and Christian Hébert, PhD, from Natural Resources Canada and the Laurentian Forestry Centre for their insights on the original datasets and access to the reports and maps associated with such.

The tutorial was built with the free and open-source software environment [R](https://www.r-project.org/) using the [leanr package](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) and and deployed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). You can find the project folders and files in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Living-Data-Tutorials/Anticosti-Historical-Data).
